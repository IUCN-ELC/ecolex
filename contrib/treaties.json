It excludes, however, any such\nsubstance or mixture which is in a manufactured product other than a container used for the transportation or storage of the substance listed.\n\n5.          ?Production? means the amount of controlled substances produced, minus the amount destroyed by technologies to be approved by the Parties.\n\n6.          ?Consumption? means production plus imports minus exports of controlled substances.\n\n7.          ?Calculated levels? of production, imports, exports and consumption means levels determined in accordance with Article 3.\n\n8.          ?Industrial rationalization? means the transfer of all or a portion of the calculated level of production of one Party to another, for the purpose of achieving\neconomic efficiencies or responding to anticipated shortfalls in supply as a result of plant closures.\n\nArticle 2:       Control Measures\n\n1.          Each Party shall ensure that for the twelve-month period commencing on the first day of the Seventh month following the date of entry into force of this\nProtocol, and in each twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed\nits calculated level of consumption in 1986. By the end of the same period, each Party producing one or more of these substances shall ensure that its\ncalculated level of production of the substances does not exceed its calculated level of production in 1986, except that such level may have increased by no\nmore than ten per cent based on the 1986 level. Such increase shall be permitted only so as to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating\nunder Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties.\n\n2.          Each Party shall ensure that for the twelve-month period commencing on the first day of the thirty-seventh month following the date of entry into force\nof this Protocol, and in each twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption of the controlled substances listed in Group II of Annex A does\nnot exceed its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party producing one or more of these substances shall ensure that its calculated level of\nproduction of the substances does not exceed its calculated level of production in 1986, except that such levels may have increased by no more than ten per\ncent based on the 1986 level. Such increase shall be permitted only so as to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under Article 5 and for\nthe purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties. The mechanisms for implementing these measures shall be decided by the Parties at their first\nmeeting following the first scientific review.\n\n3.          Each Party shall ensure that for the period I July 1993 to 30 June 1994, and in each twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption\nof the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed, annually, eighty per cent of its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party\nproducing one or more of these substances shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed,\nannually, eighty per cent of its calculated level of production in 1986. However, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under\nparagraph 1 of Article 5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to ten\nper cent of its calculated level of production in 1986.\n\n4.          Each Party shall ensure that for the period I July 1998 to 30 June 1999, and in each twelve-month period thereafter, its calculated level of consumption\nof the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed, annually, fifty per cent of its calculated level of consumption in 1986. Each Party producing\none or more of these substances shall, for the same periods, ensure that its calculated level of production of the substances does not exceed, annually, fifty\nper cent of its calculated level of production in 1986. However, in order to satisfy the basic domestic needs of the Parties operating under paragraph 1 of Article\n5 and for the purposes of industrial rationalization between Parties, its calculated level of production may exceed that limit by up to fifteen per cent of its\ncalculated level of production in 1986. This paragraph will apply unless the Parties decide otherwise at a meeting by a two-thirds majority of Parties present\nand voting, representing at least two-thirds of the total calculated level of consumption of these substances of the Parties. This decision shall be considered\nand made in the light of the assessments referred to in Article 6.\n\n5.          Any Party whose calculated level of production in 1986 of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A was less than twenty-five kilotonnes may, for\nthe purposes of industrial rationalization, transfer to or receive from any other Party, production in excess of the limits set out in paragraphs 1, 3 and 4 provided\n\nmontreal Protocol - The Ozone Secretariat http://ozone.unep.org/cgi-bin/common/print_file.pl?folder=/Ratification...\n\n1 von 5 02/07/2010 11:36\n\n\n\nthat the total combined calculated levels of production of the Parties concerned does not exceed the production limits set out in this Article.

Countries lacking adequate \ninfrastructure to monitor the import and use of these chemicals are particularly \nvulnerable.\n\nIn response to these concerns, the United Nations Environment Programme \n(UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(FAO) started developing and promoting voluntary information-exchange \nprogrammes in the mid 1980?s. FAO launched its International Code of \nConduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides in 1985 and UNEP set \nup the London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in \nInternational Trade in 1987.\n\nSoon after, the two organizations jointly introduced the 1989 Prior Informed \nConsent (PIC) procedure. Jointly implemented by FAO and UNEP this \nprogramme has helped to ensure that governments have the information \nthey need about hazardous chemicals for assessing risks and taking informed \ndecisions on chemical imports.\n\nSeeing the need for mandatory controls, of?cials attending the 1992 Rio Summit \nadopted Chapter 19 of Agenda 21, which called for the adoption of a legally \nbinding instrument on the PIC procedure by the year 2000. Consequently, the \nFAO Council (in 1994) and the UNEP Governing Council (in 1995) mandated \ntheir executive heads to launch negotiations which lead to the ?nalization of \nthe text of the Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for \nCertain Hazardous Chemicals in International Trade in March 1998.\n\nThe Convention was adopted and opened for signature at a Conference of \nPlenipotentiaries in Rotterdam on 10 September 1998 and entered into force \non 24 February 2004. \n\nThe ?rst Conference of the Parties to the Rotterdam Convention (COP-\n1) was held in September 2004 resulting in the addition of 14 chemicals to \n\nRC text inglese.indd   1 19-04-2009   10:56:30\n\n\n\nROTTERDAM CONVENTION\n\n2\n\nAnnex III (decision RC-1/3) and the adoption of Annex VI on arbitration and \nconciliation (decision RC-1/11). The amendments to Annex III entered into \nforce on 1 February 2005, except the deletion of the existing entries for \ncertain severely hazardous formulations of Monocrotophos and Parathion that \nentered into force on 1 January 2006. Annex VI, as communicated to all Parties \nby the Depositary, entered into force on 11 January 2006 in accordance with \nparagraph 3 of Article 22 of the Convention.\n\nThe fourth Conference of the Parties (COP-4) was held in October 2008 \nresulting in the addition of one chemical (all tributyltin compounds) to Annex \nIII (decision RC-4/5). This amendment to Annex III entered into force on 1 \nFebruary 2009.\n\nFAO and UNEP jointly perform the Secretariat functions for the Rotterdam \nConvention.

Management of Human Activities \n \n\n4.1 Hunting \n \n\n4.1.1 Parties shall cooperate to ensure that their hunting legislation implements the principle of \nsustainable use as envisaged in this Action Plan, taking into account the full geographical range \nof the waterbird populations concerned and their life history characteristics. \n\n \n\n4.1.2 The Agreement secretariat shall be kept informed by the Parties of their legislation relating to \nthe hunting of populations listed in Table 1. \n\n \n\n4.1.3 Parties shall cooperate with a view to developing a reliable and harmonized system for the \ncollection of harvest data in order to assess the annual harvest of populations listed in Table 1. \nThey shall provide the Agreement secretariat with estimates of the total annual take for each \npopulation, when available. \n\n \n\n4.1.4 Parties shall endeavour to phase out the use of lead shot for hunting in wetlands as soon as \npossible in accordance with self-imposed and published timetables. \n\n \n\n4.1.5 Parties shall develop and implement measures to reduce, and as far as possible eliminate, the use \nof poisoned baits. \n\n \n\n4.1.6 Parties shall develop and implement measures to reduce, and as far as possible eliminate, illegal \ntaking. \n\n \n\n4.1.7 Where appropriate, Parties shall encourage hunters, at local, national and international levels, to \nform clubs or organizations to coordinate their activities and to help ensure sustainability. \n\n \n\n4.1.8 Parties shall, where appropriate, promote the requirement of a proficiency test for hunters, \nincluding among other things, bird identification. \n\n \n\n4.2 Eco-tourism \n \n\n4.2.1 Parties shall encourage, where appropriate but not in the case of core zones of protected areas, \nthe elaboration of cooperative programmes between all concerned to develop sensitive and \nappropriate eco-tourism at wetlands holding concentrations of populations listed in Table 1. \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Parties, in cooperation with competent international organisations, shall endeavour to evaluate \nthe costs, benefits and other consequences that can result from eco-tourism at selected wetlands \n\nAgreement_engl.indd   32 25.03.2010   11:41:23\n\n\n\nAEWA Text & Annexes\n\n33\n\nwith concentrations of populations listed in Table 1. They shall communicate the results of any \nsuch evaluations to the Agreement secretariat. \n\n \n\n4.3 Other Human Activities \n \n\n4.3.1 Parties shall assess the impact of proposed projects which are likely to lead to conflicts between \npopulations listed in Table 1 that are in the areas referred to in paragraph 3.2 and human \ninterests, and shall make the results of the assessment publicly available. \n\n \n\n4.3.2 Parties shall endeavour to gather information on the damage, in particular to crops and to \nfisheries, caused by populations listed in Table 1, and report the results to the Agreement \nsecretariat. \n\n \n\n4.3.3 Parties shall cooperate with a view to identifying appropriate techniques to minimize damage, or \nto mitigate the effects of damage, in particular to crops and to fisheries, caused by populations \nlisted in Table 1, drawing on the experience gained elsewhere in the world. \n\n \n\n4.3.4 Parties shall cooperate with a view to developing single species action plans for populations \nwhich cause significant damage, in particular to crops and to fisheries. The Agreement \nsecretariat shall coordinate the development and harmonization of such plans. \n\n \n\n4.3.5 Parties shall, as far as possible, promote high environmental standards in the planning and \nconstruction of structures to minimize their impact on populations listed in Table 1. They should \nconsider steps to minimize the impact of structures already in existence where it becomes \nevident that they constitute a negative impact for the populations concerned. \n\n \n\n4.3.6 In cases where human disturbance threatens the conservation status of waterbird populations \nlisted in Table 1, Parties should endeavour to take measures to limit the level of threat. Special \nattention should be given to problem of human disturbance at breeding colonies of colonially-\nnesting waterbirds, especially when they are situated in the areas which are popular for outdoor \nrecreation. Appropriate measures might include, inter alia, the establishment of disturbance-free \nzones in protected areas where public access is not permitted. \n\n \n\n4.3.7 Parties are urged to take appropriate actions nationally or through the framework of Regional \nFisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and relevant international organisations to \nminimise the impact of fisheries3 on migratory waterbirds, and where possible cooperate \nwithin these forums, in order to decrease the mortality in areas within and beyond national \njurisdiction; appropriate measures shall especially address incidental killing and bycatch in \nfishing gear including the use of gill nets, longlines and trawling. \n \n\n4.3.8 Parties are also urged to take appropriate actions nationally or through the framework of \nRegional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs) and relevant international \norganisations to minimise the impact of fisheries on migratory waterbirds resulting in \nparticular from unsustainable fishing that causes depletion of food resources for migratory \nwaterbirds. \n \n\n4.3.9 Parties shall establish and effectively enforce adequate statutory pollution controls in \naccordance with international norms and legal agreements, particularly as related to oil spills, \ndischarge and dumping of solid wastes, for the purpose of minimizing their impacts on the \npopulations listed in Table 1. \n\n                     \n\n3\n ?fisheries? includes aquaculture and refers to either marine or freshwater fish, crustaceans, and molluscs (e.g. \n\nbivalves, gastropods and cephalopods). \n\nAgreement_engl.indd   33 25.03.2010   11:41:24\n\n\n\n34\n\nAEWA Text & Annexes\n\n4.3.10  Parties shall establish appropriate measures, ideally to eliminate or otherwise to mitigate the \nthreat from non-native terrestrial predators to breeding migratory waterbirds on islands and \nislets. Measures should refer to contingency planning to prevent invasion, emergency \nresponses to remove introduced predators, and restoration programmes for islands where \npredator populations are already established. \n \n\n4.3.11 Parties are urged to establish appropriate measures to tackle threats to migratory waterbirds \nfrom aquaculture, including environmental assessment for developments that threaten \nwetlands of importance for waterbirds, especially when dealing with new or enlargement of \nexisting installations, and involving issues such as pollution (e.g. from residues of \npharmaceutical treatments used in aquaculture or eutrophication), habitat loss, entanglement \nrisks, and introduction of non-native and potentially invasive species.? \n\n \n\n \n\n5. Research and Monitoring \n \n\n5.1 Parties shall endeavour to carry out survey work in poorly known areas, which may hold \nimportant concentrations of the populations listed in Table 1.

Mindful of the growing threat to human health and the\nenvironment posed by the increased generation and the complexity of\nhazardous wastes,\n\n2.   Further mindful that the most effective way of protection human\nhealth and the environment from the dangers posed by such wastes is\nthe reduction of their generation to a minimum in term of quantity\nand/or hazard potential,\n\n3.   Aware of the risk of damage to human health and the environment\ncaused by transboundary movements of hazardous wastes,\n\n4.   Reiterating that States should ensure that the generator should\ncarry out his responsibilities with regard to the transport and\ndisposal of hazardous wastes in a manner that is consistent with the\nprotection of human health and environment, whatever the place of\ndisposal,\n\n5.   Recalling relevant chapters of the Charter of the Organization\nof African Unity (OAU) on environmental protection the African\nCharter for Human and Peoples' Rights, Chapter IX of the Lagos Plan\nof Action and other Recommendations adopted by the Organization of\nAfrican Unity on the environment,\n\n6.   Further recognizing the sovereignty of States to ban the\nimportation into, and the transit through, their territory, of\nhazardous wastes and substances for human health and environmental\nreasons,\n\n7.   Recognizing also the increasing mobilization in Africa for the\nprohibition of transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their\ndisposal in African countries,\n\n8.   Convinced that hazardous wastes should, as far as is compatible\nwith environmentally sound and efficient management be disposed in\nthe State where they were generated,\n\n9.   Convinced that the effective control and minimization of\ntransboundary movements of hazardous wastes will act as an\nincentive, in Africa and elsewhere, for the reduction of the volume\nof the generation of such wastes,\n\n10.  Noting that a number of international and regional agreement\ndeal with the problem of the protection and preservation of the\nenvironment with regard to the transit of dangerous goods,\n\n11.  Taking into account the Declaration of the United Nations\nConference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972), the Cairo\nGuidelines and Principles for the Environmentally Sound Management\nof Hazardous Wastes adopted by the Governing Council of the United\nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) by Decision 14/30 of 17 June,\n1987, the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts\non the Transport of Dangerous Goods (formulated in 1957 and updated\nbiennially), the Charter of Human Rights, relevant recommendations,\ndeclarations, instruments and regulations adopted within the United\nNations System, the relevant articles of the 1989 Basel Convention\non the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and\ntheir Disposal which allow for the establishment of regional\nagreements which may be equal to or stronger than its own\nprovisions, Article 39 of the Lome IV Convention relating to the\ninternational movement of hazardous wastes and radioactive wastes,\nAfrican intergovernmental organizations and the work and studies\ndone within other international and regional organizations,\n\n12.  Mindful of the spirit, principles, aims and functions of the\nAfrican Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural\nResources adopted by the African Heads of State and Government in\nAlgiers (1968) and the World Charter for Nature adopted by the\nGeneral Assembly of the United Nations at its Thirty-seventh Session\n(1982) as the rule of ethics in respect of the protection of the\nhuman environment and the conservation of natural resources,\n\n13.   Concerned by the problem of transboundary traffic in hazardous\nwastes,\n\n14.  Recognizing the need to promote the development of clean\nproduction methods, including clean technologies, for the sound\nmanagement of hazardous wastes produced in Africa, in particular, to\navoid, minimize and eliminate the generation of such wastes,\n\n15.  Recognizing also that where necessary hazardous wastes should\nbe transported in accordance with relevant international conventions\nand recommendations,\n\n16.  Determined to protect, by strict control, the human health of\nthe African population and the environment against the adverse\neffects which may result from the generation of hazardous wastes,\n\n17.   Affirming a commitment also to responsibly address the problem\nof hazardous wastes originating within the Continent of Africa,\n\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nArticle 1\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purpose of this Convention:\n\n1.   \"Wastes\" are substances or materials which are disposed of, or\nare intended to be disposed of, or are required to be disposed of by\nthe provisions of national law;\n\n\n2.   \"Hazardous wastes\" means wastes as specified in Article 2 of\nthis Convention;\n\n3.   \"Management\" means the prevention and reduction of hazardous\n     wastes and the collection, transport, storage, and treatment\n     either for the reuse or disposal, of hazardous wastes\n     including after-care of disposal sites;\n\n4.   \"Transboundary movement\" means any movement of hazardous\nwastes from an area under the national jurisdiction of any State\nto or through an area under the national jurisdiction of another\nState, or to or through an area not under the national\njurisdiction of another State, provided at least two States are\ninvolved in the movement;\n\n5.   \"Clean production methods\" means production or industrial\nsystems which avoid, or eliminate the generation of hazardous\nwastes and hazardous products in conformity-with Article 4,\nsection 3 (f) and (g) of this Convention;\n\n6.   \"Disposal\" means any operation specified in Annex III to this\nConvention;\n\n7.   \"Approved site or facility\" means a site or facility for the\ndisposal of hazardous wastes which is authorized or permitted to\noperate for this purpose by a relevant authority of the State\nwhere the site or facility is located;\n\n8.    \"Competent authority\" means one governmental authority\ndesignated by a Party to be responsible, within such geographical\nareas as the Party may think fit, for receiving the notification\nof a transboundary movement of hazardous wastes and any\ninformation related to it, and for responding to such a\nnotification, as provided in Article 6 of this Convention;\n\n9.   \"Focal point\" means the entity of a Party referred to in\nArticle 5 of this Convention responsible for receiving and\nsubmitting information as provided for in Articles 13 and 16;\n\n10.  \"Environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes\" means\ntaking all practicable steps to ensure that hazardous wastes are\nmanaged in a manner which will protect human health and the\nenvironment against the adverse effects which may result from such\nwastes;\n\n11.  \"Area under the national jurisdiction of a State\" means any\nland, marine area or airspace within which a State exercises\nadministrative and regulatory responsibility in accordance with\ninternational law in regard to the protection of human health or\nthe environment;\n\n12.  \"State of export\" means a State from which a transboundary\nmovement of hazardous wastes is planned to be initiated or is\ninitiated;\n\n13.  \"State of import\" means a State to which a transboundary\nmovement is planned or takes place for the purpose of disposal\ntherein or for the purpose of loading prior to disposal in an area\nnot under the national jurisdiction of any State;\n\n14.  \"State of transit\" means any State, other than the State of\nexport or import, through which a movement of hazardous wastes is\nplanned or takes place;\n\n15.  \"States concerned\" means States of export or import, or\ntransit states, whether or not Parties;\n\n16.  \"Person\" means any natural or legal person;\n\n17.  \"Exporter\" means any person under the jurisdiction of the\nState of export who arranges for hazardous wastes to be exported;\n\n18.  \"Importer\" means any person under the jurisdiction of the\nState of import who arranges for hazardous wastes to be imported;\n\n19.  \"Carrier\" means any person who carries out the transport\nofhazardous wastes;\n\n20.  \"Generator\" means any person whose activity produces\nhazardous wastes, or, if that person is not known, the person who\nis in possession and/or control of those wastes;\n\n21.  \"Disposer\" means any person to whom hazardous wastes are\nshipped and who carries out the disposal of such wastes;\n\n22.  \"Illegal traffic\" means any transboundary movement of\nhazardous wastes as specified in Article 9 of this Convention;\n\n23.  \"Dumping at sea\" means the deliberate disposal of hazardous\nwastes at sea from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made\nstructures at sea, and includes ocean incineration and disposal\ninto the seabed and sub-seabed.\n\n\nArticle 2\nScope of the Convention\n\n1.

(Since the results of\n           open-cup tests and of closed-cup tests are not strictly\n           comparable and even individual results by the same test\n           are often variable, regulations varying from the above\n           figures to make allowance for such difference would be\n           within the spirit of this definition).\n\n\n4.1  H4.1  Flammable solids\n\n           Solids, or waste solids, other than those classed as\n           explosives, which under conditions encountered in\n           transport are readily combustible, or may cause or\n           contribute to fire through friction.\n\n\n4.2  H4.2  Substances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustion\n\n           Substances or wastes which are liable to spontaneous\n           heating under normal conditions encountered in transport,\n           or to heating up on contact with air, and being then\n           liable to catch fire.\n\n\n\n\n4.3  H4.3  Substances or wastes which, in contact with water emit\n           flammable gases\n           Substances or wastes which, by interaction with water, are\n           liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off\n           flammable gases in dangerous quantities\n\n\n5.1  H5.1  Oxidizing\n\n           Substances or wastes which, while in themselves not\n           necessarily combustible, may, generally by yielding\n           oxygen, cause or contribute to the combustion of other\n           materials.\n\n\n\n5.2  H5.2  Organic peroxides\n\n           Organic substances or wastes which contain the\n           bivalent-0-0-structure are thermally unstable substances\n           which may undergo exothermic self accelerating\n           decomposition.\n\n\n6.1  H6.1  Poisonous (Acute)\n\n           Substances or wastes liable either to cause death or\n           serious injury or to harm human health if swallowed or\n           inhaled or by skin contact.\n\n\n6.2  H6.2  Infectious substances\n\n           Substances or wastes containing viable micro organisms or\n           their toxins which are known or suspected to cause disease\n           in animals or humans.\n\n\n8    H8    Corrosives\n\n           Substances or wastes which, by chemical action, will cause\n           severe damage when in contact with living tissue, or in\n           the case of leakage, will materially damage, or even\n           destroy, other goods or the means of transport; they may\n           also cause other hazards.\n\n\n9    H10   Liberation of toxic gases in contact with air or water\n\n           Substances or wastes which, by interaction with air or\n           water, are liable to give off toxic gases in dangerous\n           quantities.\n\n9    Hll   Toxic (Delayed or chronic)\n\n           Substances or wastes which, if they are  inhaled  or\n           ingested or if they penetrate the skin, may  involve\n           delayed or chronic effects, including\n           carcinogenicity.\n\n9    H12   Ecotoxic\n\n           Substances or wastes which if  released  present  or\n           may present immediate or delayed adverse impacts  to\n           the environment by means of  bioaccumulation  and/or\n           toxic effects upon biotic systems.\n\n9    H13   Capable, by any means, after disposal,  of  yielding\n           another material, e.g.,  leachate,  which  possesses\n           any of the characteristics listed above.\n\n\nANNEX III DISPOSAL OPERATIONS\n\n\nDl   Deposit into or onto land, (e.g., landfill, etc.)\n\nD2   Land treatment, (e.g., biodegradation of liquid or sludgy\n     discards in soils, etc.)\n\nD3   Deep injection, (e.g., injection of pumpable discards into\n     wells, salt domes or naturally occurring repositories, etc.)\n\nD4   Surface impoundments, (e.g., placement of liquid or sludge\n     discards into pits, ponds, or lagoons, etc.)\n\nD5   Specially engineered landfill, (e.g., placement into lined\n     discrete cells which are capped and isolated from one another\n     and the environment, etc.)\n\nD6   Release into a water body except seas/oceans\n\nD7   Release into seas/oceans including sea-bed insertion\n\nD8   Biological treatment not specified elsewhere in this Annex\n     which results in final compounds or mixtures which  are\n     discarded by means of any of the operations in Annex III\n\nD9   Physico-chemical treatment not specified elsewhere in this\n     Annex which results in"],

Hazardous substances banned, cancelled or refused registration by government regulatory action for health or environmental reasons, are defined as hazardous wastes under the Convention. Radioactive wastes are covered also by the Convention (art. 2). Parties agree to enact legislation identifying and categorising hazardous wastes not already listed in the Convention (art. 3). Parties are to enforce a ban on hazardous waste import, and on the dumping of hazardous wastes at sea and internal waters and in respect of waste generation, they are to adopt precautionary measures (art. 4). They should establish monitoring and regulatory authorities to report and act on transboundary movement of hazardous wastes (arts. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9). Parties are to exchange information on incidents of hazardous wastes, and on approaches to a solution of the problems identified (art. 13).",

\n \n\n Recalling the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/228 of 22 December 1989 \non the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, and resolutions 43/53 \nof 6 December 1988, 44/207 of 22 December 1989, 45/212 of 21 December 1990 and 46/169 \nof 19 December 1991 on protection of global climate for present and future generations of \nmankind, \n\n Recalling also the provisions of General Assembly resolution 44/206 of \n22 December 1989 on the possible adverse effects of sea-level rise on islands and coastal \nareas, particularly low-lying coastal areas and the pertinent provisions of General Assembly \nresolution 44/172 of 19 December 1989 on the implementation of the Plan of Action to \nCombat Desertification, \n\n Recalling further the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, 1985, \nand the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, 1987, as adjusted and \namended on 29 June 1990, \n\n Noting the Ministerial Declaration of the Second World Climate Conference adopted \non 7 November 1990, \n\n Conscious of the valuable analytical work being conducted by many States on climate \nchange and of the important contributions of the World Meteorological Organization, the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme and other organs, organizations and bodies of the \nUnited Nations system, as well as other international and intergovernmental bodies, to the \nexchange of results of scientific research and the coordination of research, \n\n Recognizing that steps required to understand and address climate change will be \nenvironmentally, socially and economically most effective if they are based on relevant \nscientific, technical and economic considerations and continually re-evaluated in the light of \nnew findings in these areas, \n\n Recognizing that various actions to address climate change can be justified economically \nin their own right and can also help in solving other environmental problems, \n\n Recognizing also the need for developed countries to take immediate action in a flexible \nmanner on the basis of clear priorities, as a first step towards comprehensive response strategies \nat the global, national and, where agreed, regional levels that take into account all greenhouse \ngases, with due consideration of their relative contributions to the enhancement of the \ngreenhouse effect, \n\n Recognizing further that low-lying and other small island countries, countries with \nlow-lying coastal, arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods, drought and desertification, \nand developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the \nadverse effects of climate change, \n\n Recognizing the special difficulties of those countries, especially developing countries, \nwhose economies are particularly dependent on fossil fuel production, use and exportation, as a \nconsequence of action taken on limiting greenhouse gas emissions, \n\n\n\n- 3 - \n \n\n Affirming that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and \neconomic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on \nthe latter, taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the \nachievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty, \n\n Recognizing that all countries, especially developing countries, need access to resources \nrequired to achieve sustainable social and economic development and that, in order for \ndeveloping countries to progress towards that goal, their energy consumption will need to grow \ntaking into account the possibilities for achieving greater energy efficiency and for controlling \ngreenhouse gas emissions in general, including through the application of new technologies on \nterms which make such an application economically and socially beneficial, \n\n Determined to protect the climate system for present and future generations, \n\n Have agreed as follows: \n\nArticle 1 \n\nDEFINITIONS* \n\n For the purposes of this Convention: \n\n1. ?Adverse effects of climate change? means changes in the physical environment or biota \nresulting from climate change which have significant deleterious effects on the composition, \nresilience or productivity of natural and managed ecosystems or on the operation of \nsocio-economic systems or on human health and welfare. \n\n2. ?Climate change? means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to \nhuman activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to \nnatural climate variability observed over comparable time periods. \n\n3. ?Climate system? means the totality of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere and \ngeosphere and their interactions. \n\n4. ?Emissions? means the release of greenhouse gases and/or their precursors into the \natmosphere over a specified area and period of time. \n\n5. ?Greenhouse gases? means those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural \nand anthropogenic, that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation. \n\n6. ?Regional economic integration organization? means an organization constituted by \nsovereign States of a given region which has competence in respect of matters governed by this \nConvention or its protocols and has been duly authorized, in accordance with its internal \nprocedures, to sign, ratify, accept, approve or accede to the instruments concerned. \n\n                                                 \n\n*  Titles of articles are included solely to assist the reader. \n\n\n\n- 4 - \n \n\n7. ?Reservoir? means a component or components of the climate system where a \ngreenhouse gas or a precursor of a greenhouse gas is stored. \n\n8. ?Sink? means any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an \naerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. \n\n9. ?Source? means any process or activity which releases a greenhouse gas, an aerosol or a \nprecursor of a greenhouse gas into the atmosphere. \n\nArticle 2 \n\nOBJECTIVE \n\n The ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the \nConference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of \nthe Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that \nwould prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.  Such a level \nshould be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to \nclimate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic \ndevelopment to proceed in a sustainable manner. \n\nArticle 3 \n\nPRINCIPLES \n\n In their actions to achieve the objective of the Convention and to implement its \nprovisions, the Parties shall be guided, inter alia, by the following: \n\n1. The Parties should protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future \ngenerations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but \ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.  Accordingly, the developed country \nParties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effects thereof. \n\n2. The specific needs and special circumstances of developing country Parties, especially \nthose that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and of those \nParties, especially developing country Parties, that would have to bear a disproportionate or \nabnormal burden under the Convention, should be given full consideration. \n\n3. The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the \ncauses of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects.  Where there are threats of serious or \nirreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing \nsuch measures, taking into account that policies and measures to deal with climate change should \nbe cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the lowest possible cost.  To achieve this, \nsuch policies and measures should take into account different socio-economic contexts, be \ncomprehensive, cover all relevant sources, sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases and \nadaptation, and comprise all economic sectors.  Efforts to address climate change may be carried \nout cooperatively by interested Parties.\n\n\n\n- 5 - \n \n\n4. The Parties have a right to, and should, promote sustainable development.  Policies and \nmeasures to protect the climate system against human-induced change should be appropriate \nfor the specific conditions of each Party and should be integrated with national development \nprogrammes, taking into account that economic development is essential for adopting measures \nto address climate change. \n\n5. The Parties should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic \nsystem that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development in all Parties, \nparticularly developing country Parties, thus enabling them better to address the problems of \nclimate change.  Measures taken to combat climate change, including unilateral ones, should not \nconstitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on \ninternational trade. \n\nArticle 4 \n\nCOMMITMENTS \n\n1. All Parties, taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their \nspecific national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances, shall: \n (a) Develop, periodically update, publish and make available to the Conference of \nthe Parties, in accordance with Article 12, national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by \nsources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, \nusing comparable methodologies to be agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties; \n\n (b) Formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and, where \nappropriate, regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change by \naddressing anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases \nnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol, and measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to \nclimate change; \n\n (c) Promote and cooperate in the development, application and diffusion, \nincluding transfer, of technologies, practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent \nanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol in all \nrelevant sectors, including the energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste \nmanagement sectors; \n\n (d) Promote sustainable management, and promote and cooperate in the conservation \nand enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled \nby the Montreal Protocol, including biomass, forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial, \ncoastal and marine ecosystems; \n\n (e) Cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change; develop \nand elaborate appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zone management, water resources and \nagriculture, and for the protection and rehabilitation of areas, particularly in Africa, affected by \ndrought and desertification, as well as floods;\n\n\n\n- 6 - \n \n\n (f) Take climate change considerations into account, to the extent feasible, in their \nrelevant social, economic and environmental policies and actions, and employ appropriate \nmethods, for example impact assessments, formulated and determined nationally, with a view \nto minimizing adverse effects on the economy, on public health and on the quality of \nthe environment, of projects or measures undertaken by them to mitigate or adapt to climate \nchange; \n\n (g) Promote and cooperate in scientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and \nother research, systematic observation and development of data archives related to the climate \nsystem and intended to further the understanding and to reduce or eliminate the remaining \nuncertainties regarding the causes, effects, magnitude and timing of climate change and the \neconomic and social consequences of various response strategies; \n\n (h) Promote and cooperate in the full, open and prompt exchange of relevant \nscientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and legal information related to the climate \nsystem and climate change, and to the economic and social consequences of various response \nstrategies; \n\n (i) Promote and cooperate in education, training and public awareness related to \nclimate change and encourage the widest participation in this process, including that of \nnon-governmental organizations; and \n\n (j) Communicate to the Conference of the Parties information related to \nimplementation, in accordance with Article 12. \n\n2. The developed country Parties and other Parties included in Annex I commit themselves \nspecifically as provided for in the following: \n\n (a) Each of these Parties shall adopt national1 policies and take corresponding \nmeasures on the mitigation of climate change, by limiting its anthropogenic emissions of \ngreenhouse gases and protecting and enhancing its greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs.  These \npolicies and measures will demonstrate that developed countries are taking the lead in modifying \nlonger-term trends in anthropogenic emissions consistent with the objective of the Convention, \nrecognizing that the return by the end of the present decade to earlier levels of anthropogenic \nemissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol \nwould contribute to such modification, and taking into account the differences in these Parties? \nstarting points and approaches, economic structures and resource bases, the need to maintain \nstrong and sustainable economic growth, available technologies and other individual \ncircumstances, as well as the need for equitable and appropriate contributions by each of these \nParties to the global effort regarding that objective.  These Parties may implement such \npolicies and measures jointly with other Parties and may assist other Parties in contributing \nto the achievement of the objective of the Convention and, in particular, that of this \nsubparagraph;\n\n                                                 \n\n1\n  This includes policies and measures adopted by regional economic integration organizations. \n\n\n\n- 7 - \n \n\n (b) In order to promote progress to this end, each of these Parties shall communicate, \nwithin six months of the entry into force of the Convention for it and periodically thereafter, and \nin accordance with Article 12, detailed information on its policies and measures referred to in \nsubparagraph (a) above, as well as on its resulting projected anthropogenic emissions by sources \nand removals by sinks of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol for the \nperiod referred to in subparagraph (a), with the aim of returning individually or jointly to \ntheir 1990 levels these anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases \nnot controlled by the Montreal Protocol.  This information will be reviewed by the Conference of \nthe Parties, at its first session and periodically thereafter, in accordance with Article 7; \n\n (c) Calculations of emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases \nfor the purposes of subparagraph (b) above should take into account the best available scientific \nknowledge, including of the effective capacity of sinks and the respective contributions of such \ngases to climate change.  The Conference of the Parties shall consider and agree on \nmethodologies for these calculations at its first session and review them regularly thereafter; \n\n (d) The Conference of the Parties shall, at its first session, review the adequacy of \nsubparagraphs (a) and (b) above.  Such review shall be carried out in the light of the best \navailable scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts, as well as \nrelevant technical, social and economic information.  Based on this review, the Conference of \nthe Parties shall take appropriate action, which may include the adoption of amendments to the \ncommitments in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.  The Conference of the Parties, at its first \nsession, shall also take decisions regarding criteria for joint implementation as indicated in \nsubparagraph (a) above.  A second review of subparagraphs (a) and (b) shall take place not later \nthan 31 December 1998, and thereafter at regular intervals determined by the Conference of the \nParties, until the objective of the Convention is met; \n (e) Each of these Parties shall: \n\n(i) coordinate as appropriate with other such Parties, relevant economic and \nadministrative instruments developed to achieve the objective of the \nConvention; and \n\n(ii) identify and periodically review its own policies and practices which \nencourage activities that lead to greater levels of anthropogenic emissions \nof greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol than would \notherwise occur; \n\n (f) The Conference of the Parties shall review, not later than 31 December 1998, \navailable information with a view to taking decisions regarding such amendments to the lists \nin Annexes I and II as may be appropriate, with the approval of the Party concerned; \n\n (g) Any Party not included in Annex I may, in its instrument of ratification, \nacceptance, approval or accession, or at any time thereafter, notify the Depositary that it intends \nto be bound by subparagraphs (a) and (b) above.  The Depositary shall inform the other \nsignatories and Parties of any such notification.\n\n\n\n- 8 - \n \n\n3. The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II shall \nprovide new and additional financial resources to meet the agreed full costs incurred by \ndeveloping country Parties in complying with their obligations under Article 12, paragraph 1.  \nThey shall also provide such financial resources, including for the transfer of technology, needed \nby the developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing \nmeasures that are covered by paragraph 1 of this Article and that are agreed between a \ndeveloping country Party and the international entity or entities referred to in Article 11, in \naccordance with that Article.  The implementation of these commitments shall take into account \nthe need for adequacy and predictability in the flow of funds and the importance of appropriate \nburden sharing among the developed country Parties. \n\n4. The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II shall \nalso assist the developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of \nclimate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects. \n\n5. The developed country Parties and other developed Parties included in Annex II shall \ntake all practicable steps to promote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer of, or \naccess to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how to other Parties, particularly \ndeveloping country Parties, to enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention.

Appendix I shall include all species threatened with extinction\nwhich are or may be affected by trade.  Trade in specimens of these\nspecies must be subject to particularly strict regulation in order not\nto endanger further their survival and must only be authorized in\nexceptional circumstances.\n\n2.    Appendix II shall include:\n\n      a)   all species which although not necessarily now threatened\n           with extinction may become so unless trade in specimens of\n           such species is subject to strict regulation in order to\n           avoid utilization incompatible with their survival; and\n\n      b)   other species which must be subject to regulation in order\n           that trade in specimens of certain species referred to in\n           subparagraph (a) of this paragraph may be brought under\n           effective control.\n\n3.    Appendix III shall include all species which any Party identifies\nas being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for the purposes\nof preventing or restricting exploitation, and as needing the\ncooperation of other parties in the control of trade.\n\n4.    The Parties shall not allow trade in specimens of species\nincluded in Appendices I, II and III except in accordance with the\nprovisions of the present Convention.\n\n\nArticle III\n\nRegulation of trade in specimens of species included in appendix i\n\n1.    All trade in specimens of species included in Appendix I shall\nbe in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n2.    The export of any specimen of a species included in Appendix I\nshall require the prior grant and presentation of an export permit. \nAn export permit shall only be granted when the following conditions\nhave been met:\n\n      a)   a Scientific Authority of the State of export has advised\n           that such export will not be detrimental to the survival of\n           that species;\n\n      b)   a Management Authority of the State of export is satisfied\n           that the specimen was not obtained in contravention of the\n           laws of that State for the protection of fauna and flora;\n\n      c)   a Management Authority of the State of export is satisfied\n           that any living specimen will be so prepared and shipped as\n           to minimize the risk of injury, damage to health or cruel\n           treatment; and\n\n      d)   a Management Authority of the State of export is satisfied\n           that an import permit has been granted for the specimen.\n\n3.    The import of any specimen of a species included in Appendix I\nshall require the prior grant and presentation of an import permit and\neither an export permit or a re-export certificate.  An import permit\nshall only be granted when the following conditions have been met:\n\n      a)   a Scientific Authority of the State of import has advised\n           that the import will be for purposes which are not\n           detrimental to the survival of the species involved;\n\n      b)   a Scientific Authority of the State of import is satisfied\n           that the proposed recipient of a living specimen is\n           suitably equipped to house and care for it; and\n\n      c)   a Management Authority of the State of import is satisfied\n           that the specimen is not to be used for primarily\n           commercial purposes.\n\n4.    The re-export of any specimen of a species included in Appendix\nI shall require the prior grant and presentation of a reexport\ncertificate.

For the purpose of this Convention:\n\n      a) \"Migratory species\" means the entire population or any\ngeographically separate part of the population of any species or lower\ntaxon of wild animals, a significant proportion of whose members\ncyclically and predictably cross one or more national jurisdictional\nboundaries;\n\n      b) \"Conservation status of a migratory species\" means the sum of\nthe influences acting on the migratory species that may affect its\nlong-term distribution and abundance;\n\n      c) \"Conservation status\" will be taken as \"favourable\" when:\n\n      (1)  population dynamics data indicate that the migratory\n           species is maintaining itself on a long-term basis as a\n           viable component of its ecosystems;\n      (2)  the range of the migratory species is neither currently\n           being reduced, nor is likely to be reduced, on a long-term\n           basis;\n      (3)  there is, and will be in the foreseeable future, sufficient\n           habitat to maintain the population of the migratory species\n           on a long-term basis; and\n      (4)  the distribution and abundance of the migratory species\n           approach historic coverage and levels to the extent that\n           potentially suitable ecosystems exist and to the extent\n           consistent with wise wildlife management;\n\n      d)   \"Conservation status\" will be taken as \"unfavourable\" if any\nof the conditions set out in sub-paragraph (c) of this paragraph is not\nmet;\n\n      e)   \"Endangered\" in relation to a particular migratory species\nmeans that the migratory species is in danger of extinction throughout\nall or a significant portion of its range;\n\n      f)   \"Range\" means all the areas of land or water that a\nmigratory species inhabits, stays in temporarily, crosses or overflies\nat any time on its normal migration route;\n\n      g)   \"Habitat\" means any area in the range of a migratory species\nwhich contains suitable living conditions for that species;\n\n      h)   \"Range State\" in relation to a particular migratory species\nmeans any State (and where appropriate any other Party referred to\nunder sub-paragraph (k) of this paragraph) that exercises jurisdiction\nover any part of the range of that migratory species, or a State, flag\nvessels of which are engaged outside national jurisdictional limits in\ntaking that migratory species;\n\n      i)   \"Taking\" means taking, hunting, fishing, capturing,\nharassing, deliberate killing, or attempting to engage in any such\nconduct;\n\n      j)   \"AGREEMENT\" means an international agreement relating to the\nconservation of one or more migratory species as provided for in\nArticles IV and V of this Convention; and\n\n      k)   \"Party\" means a State or any regional economic integration\norganization constituted by sovereign States which has competence in\nrespect of the negotiation, conclusion and application of international\nagreements in matters covered by this Convention for which this\nConvention is in force.\n\n2.    In matters within their competence, the regional economic\nintegration organizations which are Parties to this Convention shall\nin their own name exercise the rights and fulfil the responsibilities\nwhich this Convention attributes to their member States. In such cases\nthe member States of these organizations shall not be entitled to\nexercise such rights individually.\n\n3.    Where this Convention provides for a decision to be taken by\neither a two-thirds majority or a unanimous decision of \"the Parties\npresent and voting\" this shall mean \"the Parties present and casting\nan affirmative or negative vote\". Those abstaining from voting shall\nnot be counted amongst \"the Parties present and voting\" in determining\nthe majority.\n\n\nArticle II\nFundamental Principles\n\n1.    The Parties acknowledge the importance of migratory species being\nconserved and of Range States agreeing to take action to this end\nwhenever possible and appropriate, paying special attention to\nmigratory species the conservation status of which is unfavourable, and\ntaking individually or in co-operation appropriate and necessary steps\nto conserve such species and their habitat.\n\n2.    The Parties acknowledge the need to take action to avoid any\nmigratory species becoming endangered.\n\n3.    In particular, the Parties:\n\n      a)   should promote, co-operate in and support research relating\nto migratory species;\n\n      b)   shall endeavour to provide immediate protection for\nmigratory species included in Appendix I; and,\n\n      c)   shall endeavour to conclude AGREEMENTS covering the\nconservation and management of migratory species included in Appendix\nII.\n\n\nArticle III\nEndangered Migratory Species: Appendix I\n\n1.    Appendix I shall list migratory species which are endangered.\n\n2.    A migratory species may be listed in Appendix I provided that\nreliable evidence, including the best scientific evidence available,\nindicates that the species is endangered.\n\n3.    A migratory species may be removed from Appendix I when the\nConference of the Parties determines that:\n\n      a)   reliable evidence, including the best scientific evidence\navailable, indicates that the species is no longer endangered, and\n\n      b)   the species is not likely to become endangered again because\nof loss of protection due to its removal from Appendix I.\n\n4.    Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in\nAppendix I shall endeavour:\n\n      a)   to conserve and, where feasible and appropriate, restore\nthose habitats of the species which are of importance in removing the\nspecies from danger of extinction;\n\n      b)   to prevent, remove, compensate for or minimize, as\nappropriate, the adverse effects of activities or obstacles that\nseriously impede or prevent the migration of the species; and\n\n      c)   to the extent feasible and appropriate, to prevent, reduce\nor control factors that are endangering or are likely to further\nendanger the species, including strictly controlling the introduction\nof, or controlling or eliminating, already introduced exotic species.\n\n5.    Parties that are Range States of a migratory species listed in\nAppendix I shall prohibit the taking of animals belonging to such\nspecies. Exceptions may be made to this prohibition only if:\n\n      a)   the taking is for scientific purposes;\n\n      b)   the taking is for the purpose of enhancing the propagation\nor survival of the affected species;\n\n      c)   the taking is to accommodate the needs of traditional\nsubsistence users of such species; or\n\n      d)   extraordinary circumstances so require;\n\n      provided that such exceptions are precise as to content and\nlimited in space and time. Such taking should not operate to the\ndisadvantage of the species.\n\n6.    The Conference of the Parties may recommend to the Parties that\nare Range States of a migratory species listed in Appendix I that they\ntake further measures considered appropriate to benefit the species.\n\n7.    The Parties shall as soon as possible inform the Secretariat of\nany exceptions made pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article.\n\nArticle IV\nMigratory Species to Be the Subject of AGREEMENTS:\n\nAppendix II\n\n1.    Appendix II shall list migratory species which have an\nunfavourable conservation status and which require international\nagreements for their conservation and management, as well as those\nwhich have a conservation status which would significantly benefit from\nthe international co-operation that could be achieved by an\ninternational agreement.\n\n2.    If the circumstances so warrant, a migratory species may be\nlisted both in Appendix I and Appendix II.\n\n3.    Parties that are Range States of migratory species listed in\nAppendix II shall endeavour to conclude AGREEMENTS where these would\nbenefit the species and should give priority to those species in an\nunfavourable conservation status.\n\n4.    Parties are encouraged to take action with a view to concluding\nagreements for any population or any geographically separate part of\nthe population of any species or lower taxon of wild animals, members\nof which periodically cross one or more national jurisdictional\nboundaries.\n\n5.    The Secretariat shall be provided with a copy of each AGREEMENT\nconcluded pursuant to the provisions of this Article.\n\n\nArticle V\nGuidelines for AGREEMENTS\n\n1.    The object of each AGREEMENT shall be to restore the migratory\nspecies concerned to a favourable conservation status or to maintain\nit in such a status. Each AGREEMENT should deal with those aspects of\nthe conservation and management of the migratory species concerned\nwhich serve to achieve that object.\n\n2.    Each AGREEMENT should cover the whole of the range of the\nmigratory species concerned and should be open to accession by all\nRange States of that species, whether or not they are Parties to this\nConvention.\n\n3.    An AGREEMENT should, wherever possible, deal with more than one\nmigratory species.\n\n4.    Each AGREEMENT should:\n\n      a)   identify the migratory species covered;\n\n      b)   describe the range and migration route of the migratory\nspecies;\n\n      c)   provide for each Party to designate its national authority\nconcerned with the implementation of the AGREEMENT;\n\n      d)   establish, if necessary. appropriate machinery to assist in\ncarrying out the aims of the AGREEMENT, to monitor its effectiveness,\nand to prepare reports for the Conference of the Parties;\n\n      e)   provide for procedures for the settlement of disputes\nbetween Parties to the AGREEMENT; and\n\n      f)   at a minimum, prohibit, in relation to a migratory species\nof the Order Cetacea, any taking that is not permitted for that\nmigratory species under any other multilateral agreement and provide\nfor accession to the AGREEMENT by States that are not Range States of\nthat migratory species.\n\n5.    Where appropriate and feasible, each AGREEMENT should provide\nfor, but not be limited to:\n\n      a)   periodic review of the conservation status of the migratory\nspecies concerned and the identification of the factors which may be\nharmful to that status;\n\n      b)   coordinated conservation and management plans;\n\n      c)   research into the ecology and population dynamics of the\nmigratory species concerned, with special regard to migration;\n\n      d ) the exchange of information on the migratory species\nconcerned, special regard being paid to the exchange of the results of\nresearch and of relevant statistics;\n\n      e)   conservation and, where required and feasible, restoration\nof the habitats of importance in maintaining a favourable conservation\nstatus, and protection of such habitats from disturbances, including\nstrict control of the introduction of, or control of already\nintroduced, exotic species detrimental to the migratory species;\n\n      f)   maintenance of a network of suitable habitats appropriately\ndisposed in relation to the migration route;\n\n      g)   where it appears desirable, the provision of new habitats\nfavourable to the migratory species or reintroduction of the migratory\nspecies into favourable habitats;\n\n      h)   elimination of, to the maximum extent possible, or\ncompensation for activities and obstacles which hinder or impede\nmigration;\n\n      i)   prevention, reduction or control of the release into the\nhabitat of the migratory species of substances harmful to that\nmigratory species;\n\n      j)   measures based on sound ecological principles to control and\nmanage the taking of the migratory species;\n\n      k)   procedures for coordinating action to suppress illegal\ntaking;\n\n      l)   exchange of information on substantial threats to the\nmigratory species;\n\n      m)   emergency procedures whereby conservation action would be\nconsiderably and, rapidly strengthened when the conservation status of\nthe migratory species is seriously affected; and\n\n      n)   making the general public aware of the contents and aims of\nthe AGREEMENT.\n\n\nArticle VI\nRange States\n\n1.

The\nboundaries of each wetland shall be and they may incorporate\nriparian and coastal zones adjacent to the wetlands, and islands or\nbodies of marine water deeper than six metres at low tide lying\nwithin the wetlands, especially where these have importance as\nwaterfowl habitat.\n\n2.    Wetlands should be elected for the List on account of their\ninternational significance in terms of ecology, botany, zoology,\nlimnology or hydrology. In the first instance wetlands of\ninternational importance to waterfowl at any season should be\nincluded.\n\n3.    The inclusion of a wetland in the List does not prejudice the\nexclusive sovereign rights of the Contracting Party in whose\nterritory the wetland is situated.\n\n4.

Each Contracting Party shall promote the conservation of\nwetlands and waterfowl by establishing nature reserves in wetlands,\nwhether they are included in the List or not, and provide adequately\nfor their wardening.\n\n2.    Where a Contracting Party in its urgent national interest,\ndeletes or restricts the boundaries of a wetland included in the\nList, it should as far as possible compensate for any loss of\nwetland resources, and in particular it should create additional\nnature reserves for waterfowl and for the protection, either in the\nsame area or elsewhere, of an adequate portion of the original\nhabitat.\n\n3.    The Contracting Parties shall encourage research and the\nexchange of data and publications regarding wetlands and their flora\nand fauna.\n\n4.    The Contracting Parties shall endeavour through management to\nincrease waterfowl populations on appropriate wetlands.\n\n5.

resist \ndegradation, bioaccumulate and are transported, through air, water and migratory species, \nacross international boundaries and deposited far from their place of release, where they \naccumulate in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, \n \n Aware of the health concerns, especially in developing countries, resulting from local \nexposure to persistent organic pollutants, in particular impacts upon women and, through \nthem, upon future generations, \n \n Acknowledging that the Arctic ecosystems and indigenous communities are particularly \nat risk because of the biomagnification of persistent organic pollutants and that contamination \nof their traditional foods is a public health issue, \n \n Conscious of the need for global action on persistent organic pollutants, \n \n Mindful of decision 19/13 C of 7 February 1997 of the Governing Council of the \nUnited Nations Environment Programme to initiate international action to protect human \nhealth and the environment through measures which will reduce and/or eliminate emissions \nand discharges of persistent organic pollutants, \n \n Recalling the pertinent provisions of the relevant international environmental \nconventions, especially the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure \nfor Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade, and the Basel \nConvention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their \nDisposal including the regional agreements developed within the framework of its Article 11, \n \n Recalling also the pertinent provisions of the Rio Declaration on Environment and \nDevelopment and Agenda 21, \n \n Acknowledging that precaution underlies the concerns of all the Parties and is \nembedded within this Convention, \n \n Recognizing that this Convention and other international agreements in the field of \ntrade and the environment are mutually supportive, \n \n Reaffirming that States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and \nthe principles of international law, the sovereign right to exploit their own resources \npursuant to their own environmental and developmental policies, and the responsibility to \nensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the \nenvironment of other States or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, \n \n Taking into account the circumstances and particular requirements of developing \ncountries, in particular the least developed among them, and countries with economies in \ntransition, especially the need to strengthen their national capabilities for the management of \nchemicals, including through the transfer of technology, the provision of financial and \ntechnical assistance and the promotion of cooperation among the Parties, \n \n\n\n\n 2\n\n Taking full account of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of \nSmall Island Developing States, adopted in Barbados on 6 May 1994, \n \n Noting the respective capabilities of developed and developing countries, as well as the \ncommon but differentiated responsibilities of States as set forth in Principle 7 of the Rio \nDeclaration on Environment and Development, \n \n Recognizing the important contribution that the private sector and non-governmental \norganizations can make to achieving the reduction and/or elimination of emissions and \ndischarges of persistent organic pollutants, \n \n Underlining the importance of manufacturers of persistent organic pollutants taking \nresponsibility for reducing adverse effects caused by their products and for providing \ninformation to users, Governments and the public on the hazardous properties of those \nchemicals, \n \n Conscious of the need to take measures to prevent adverse effects caused by persistent \norganic pollutants at all stages of their life cycle, \n \n Reaffirming Principle 16 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development \nwhich states that national authorities should endeavour to promote the internalization of \nenvironmental costs and the use of economic instruments, taking into account the approach \nthat the polluter should, in principle, bear the cost of pollution, with due regard to the public \ninterest and without distorting international trade and investment, \n \n Encouraging Parties not having regulatory and assessment schemes for pesticides and \nindustrial chemicals to develop such schemes, \n \n Recognizing the importance of developing and using environmentally sound alternative \nprocesses and chemicals, \n \n Determined to protect human health and the environment from the harmful impacts of \npersistent organic pollutants, \n \n Have agreed as follows: \n \n\nArticle 1 \n \n\nObjective \n \n Mindful of the precautionary approach as set forth in Principle 15 of the Rio \nDeclaration on Environment and Development, the objective of this Convention is to protect \nhuman health and the environment from persistent organic pollutants.  \n \n\nArticle 2 \n \n\nDefinitions \n \n For the purposes of this Convention: \n \n (a) ?Party? means a State or regional economic

The report \nshall be circulated by the Secretariat to all Parties.  The review of a registration shall be \ncarried out on the basis of all available information.  Thereupon, the Conference of the Parties \nmay make such recommendations to the Party concerned as it deems appropriate. \n \n7. The Conference of the Parties may, upon request from the Party concerned, decide to \nextend the expiry date of a specific exemption for a period of up to five years.  In making its \ndecision, the Conference of the Parties shall take due account of the special circumstances of \nthe developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition. \n \n8. A Party may, at any time, withdraw an entry from the Register for a specific exemption \nupon written notification to the Secretariat.  The withdrawal shall take effect on the date \nspecified in the notification. \n \n9. When there are no longer any Parties registered for a particular type of specific \nexemption, no new registrations may be made with respect to it. \n \n\nArticle 5 \n \n\nMeasures to reduce or eliminate releases from unintentional production \n \n Each Party shall at a minimum take the following measures to reduce the total releases \nderived from anthropogenic sources of each of the chemicals listed in Annex C, with the goal \nof their continuing minimization and, where feasible, ultimate elimination: \n \n (a) Develop an action plan or, where appropriate, a regional or subregional action \nplan within two years of the date of entry into force of this Convention for it, and \nsubsequently implement it as part of its implementation plan specified in Article 7, designed \nto identify, characterize and address the release of the chemicals listed in Annex C and to \n\n\n\n 6\n\nfacilitate implementation of subparagraphs (b) to (e). The action plan shall include the \nfollowing elements: \n \n\n(i) An evaluation of current and projected releases, including the development \nand maintenance of source inventories and release estimates, taking into \nconsideration the source categories identified in Annex C; \n\n \n(ii) An evaluation of the efficacy of the laws and policies of the Party relating to \n\nthe management of such releases; \n \n(iii) Strategies to meet the obligations of this paragraph, taking into account the \n\nevaluations in (i) and (ii); \n \n(iv) Steps to promote education and training with regard to, and awareness of, \n\nthose strategies;  \n \n(v) A review every five years of those strategies and of their success in meeting \n\nthe obligations of this paragraph; such reviews shall be included in reports \nsubmitted pursuant to Article 15;  \n\n \n(vi) A schedule for implementation of the action plan, including for the \n\nstrategies and measures identified therein; \n \n\n (b) Promote the application of available, feasible and practical measures that can \nexpeditiously achieve a realistic and meaningful level of release reduction or source \nelimination;  \n \n (c) Promote the development and, where it deems appropriate, require the use of \nsubstitute or modified materials, products and processes to prevent the formation and release \nof the chemicals listed in Annex C, taking into consideration the general guidance on \nprevention and release reduction measures in Annex C and guidelines to be adopted by \ndecision of the Conference of the Parties;  \n \n (d) Promote and, in accordance with the implementation schedule of its action plan, \nrequire the use of best available techniques for new sources within source categories which a \nParty has identified as warranting such action in its action plan, with a particular initial focus \non source categories identified in Part II of Annex C.  In any case, the requirement to use best \navailable techniques for new sources in the categories listed in Part II of that Annex shall be \nphased in as soon as practicable but no later than four years after the entry into force of the \nConvention for that Party.  For the identified categories, Parties shall promote the use of best \nenvironmental practices.  When applying best available techniques and best environmental \npractices, Parties should take into consideration the general guidance on prevention and \nrelease reduction measures in that Annex and guidelines on best available techniques and best \nenvironmental practices to be adopted by decision of the Conference of the Parties; \n \n (e) Promote, in accordance with its action plan, the use of best available techniques \nand best environmental practices: \n \n\n(i) For existing sources, within the source categories listed in Part II of Annex \nC and within source categories such as those in Part III of that Annex; and \n\n \n\n\n\n 7\n\n(ii) For new sources, within source categories such as those listed in Part III of \nAnnex C which a Party has not addressed under subparagraph (d). \n\n \nWhen applying best available techniques and best environmental practices, Parties should take \ninto consideration the general guidance on prevention and release reduction measures in Annex \nC and guidelines on best available techniques and best environmental practices to be adopted \nby decision of the Conference of the Parties; \n \n (f) For the purposes of this paragraph and Annex C: \n \n\n(i) ?Best available techniques? means the most effective and advanced stage in \nthe development of activities and their methods of operation which indicate \nthe practical suitability of particular techniques for providing in principle \nthe basis for release limitations designed to prevent and, where that is not \npracticable, generally to reduce releases of chemicals listed in Part I of \nAnnex C and their impact on the environment as a whole. In this regard: \n\n \n(ii) ?Techniques? includes both the technology used and the way in which the \n\ninstallation is designed, built, maintained, operated and decommissioned; \n \n(iii) ?Available? techniques means those techniques that are accessible to the \n\noperator and that are developed on a scale that allows implementation in the \nrelevant industrial sector, under economically and technically viable \nconditions, taking into consideration the costs and advantages; and \n\n \n(iv) ?Best? means most effective in achieving a high general level of protection \n\nof the environment as a whole; \n \n(v) ?Best environmental practices? means the application of the most \n\nappropriate combination of environmental control measures and strategies; \n \n\n(vi) ?New source? means any source of which the construction or substantial \nmodification is commenced at least one year after the date of:  \n \n\na. Entry into force of this Convention for the Party concerned; or  \n \nb. Entry into force for the Party concerned of an amendment to Annex C \n\nwhere the source becomes subject to the provisions of this \nConvention only by virtue of that amendment. \n\n \n (g) Release limit values or performance standards may be used by a Party to fulfill its \ncommitments for best available techniques under this paragraph. \n \n\nArticle 6 \n \n\nMeasures to reduce or eliminate releases from stockpiles and wastes \n \n1. In order to ensure that stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals listed either in \nAnnex A or Annex B and wastes, including products and articles upon becoming wastes, \nconsisting of, containing or contaminated with a chemical listed in Annex A, B or C, are \nmanaged in a manner protective of human health and the environment, each Party shall: \n \n\n\n\n 8\n\n (a) Develop appropriate strategies for identifying:  \n \n\n(i) Stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals listed either in Annex A or \nAnnex B; and \n\n \n(ii) Products and articles in use and wastes consisting of, containing or \n\ncontaminated with a chemical listed in Annex A, B or C; \n \n (b) Identify, to the extent practicable, stockpiles consisting of or containing chemicals \nlisted either in Annex A or Annex B on the basis of the strategies referred to in subparagraph \n(a); \n \n (c) Manage stockpiles, as appropriate, in a safe, efficient and environmentally sound \nmanner.  Stockpiles of chemicals listed either in Annex A or Annex B, after they are no \nlonger allowed to be used according to any specific exemption specified in Annex A or any \nspecific exemption or acceptable purpose specified in Annex B, except stockpiles which are \nallowed to be exported according to paragraph 2 of Article 3, shall be deemed to be waste and \nshall be managed in accordance with subparagraph (d); \n \n (d) Take appropriate measures so that such wastes, including products and articles \nupon becoming wastes, are: \n \n\n(i) Handled, collected, transported and stored in an environmentally sound \nmanner;  \n\n \n(ii) Disposed of in such a way that the persistent organic pollutant content is \n\ndestroyed or irreversibly transformed so that they do not exhibit the \ncharacteristics of persistent organic pollutants or otherwise disposed of in an \nenvironmentally sound manner when destruction or irreversible \ntransformation does not represent the environmentally preferable option or \nthe persistent organic pollutant content is low, taking into account \ninternational rules, standards, and guidelines, including those that may be \ndeveloped pursuant to paragraph 2, and  relevant global and regional \nregimes governing the management of hazardous wastes; \n\n \n(iii) Not permitted to be subjected to disposal operations that may lead to \n\nrecovery, recycling, reclamation, direct reuse or alternative uses of \npersistent organic pollutants; and \n\n \n(iv) Not transported across international boundaries without taking into account \n\nrelevant international rules, standards and guidelines; \n \n (e) Endeavour to develop appropriate strategies for identifying sites contaminated by \nchemicals listed in Annex A, B or C; if remediation of those sites is undertaken it shall be \nperformed in an environmentally sound manner. \n \n\n\n\n 9\n\n2. The Conference of the Parties shall cooperate closely with the appropriate bodies of the \nBasel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and \ntheir Disposal to, inter alia: \n \n\n(a) Establish levels of destruction and irreversible transformation necessary to ensure \nthat the characteristics of persistent organic pollutants as specified in paragraph 1 of Annex D \nare not exhibited;  \n\n \n(b) Determine what they consider to be the methods that constitute environmentally \n\nsound disposal referred to above; and  \n \n\n(c) Work to establish, as appropriate, the concentration levels of the chemicals listed \nin Annexes A, B and C in order to define the low persistent organic pollutant content referred \nto in paragraph 1 (d) (ii).  \n \n\nArticle 7 \n \n\nImplementation plans \n \n1. Each Party shall: \n\n \n (a) Develop and endeavour to implement a plan for the implementation of its \nobligations under this Convention; \n\n \n (b) Transmit its implementation plan to the Conference of the Parties within two \nyears of the date on which this Convention enters into force for it; and  \n \n (c) Review and update, as appropriate, its implementation plan on a periodic basis \nand in a manner to be specified by a decision of the Conference of the Parties.  \n \n2.  The Parties shall, where appropriate, cooperate directly or through global, regional and \nsubregional organizations, and consult their national stakeholders, including women?s groups \nand groups involved in the health of children, in order to facilitate the development, \nimplementation and updating of their implementation plans. \n \n3. The Parties shall endeavour to utilize and, where necessary, establish the means to \nintegrate national implementation plans for persistent organic pollutants in their sustainable \ndevelopment strategies where appropriate. \n \n\nArticle 8 \n \n\nListing of chemicals in Annexes A, B and C \n \n1. A Party may submit a proposal to the Secretariat for listing a chemical in Annexes A, B \nand/or C.  The proposal shall contain the information specified in Annex D.  In developing a \nproposal, a Party may be assisted by other Parties and/or by the Secretariat. \n \n2. The Secretariat shall verify whether the proposal contains the information specified in \nAnnex D.  If the Secretariat is satisfied that the proposal contains the information so specified, \nit shall forward the proposal to the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee. \n \n\n\n\n 10\n\n3. The Committee shall examine the proposal and apply the screening criteria specified in \nAnnex D in a flexible and transparent way, taking all information provided into account in an \nintegrative and balanced manner.   \n \n4. If the Committee decides that: \n \n (a) It is satisfied that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, it shall, through the \nSecretariat, make the proposal and the evaluation of the Committee available to all Parties and \nobservers and invite them to submit the information specified in Annex E; or \n \n (b)  It is not satisfied that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, it shall, through \nthe Secretariat, inform all Parties and observers and make the proposal and the evaluation of \nthe Committee available to all Parties and the proposal shall be set aside. \n \n5.   Any Party may resubmit a proposal to the Committee that has been set aside by the \nCommittee pursuant to paragraph 4.  The resubmission may include any concerns of the Party \nas well as a justification for additional consideration by the Committee.  If, following this \nprocedure, the Committee again sets the proposal aside, the Party may challenge the decision \nof the Committee and the Conference of the Parties shall consider the matter at its next \nsession.  The Conference of the Parties may decide, based on the screening criteria in Annex \nD and taking into account the evaluation of the Committee and any additional information \nprovided by any Party or observer, that the proposal should proceed. \n \n6. Where the Committee has decided that the screening criteria have been fulfilled, or the \nConference of the Parties has decided that the proposal should proceed, the Committee shall \nfurther review the proposal, taking into account any relevant additional information received, \nand shall prepare a draft risk profile in accordance with Annex E.  It shall, through the \nSecretariat, make that draft available to all Parties and observers, collect technical comments \nfrom them and, taking those comments into account, complete the risk profile.  \n \n7. If, on the basis of the risk profile conducted in accordance with Annex E, the \nCommittee decides: \n \n (a) That the chemical is likely as a result of its long-range environmental transport to \nlead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects such that global action \nis warranted, the proposal shall proceed.  Lack of full scientific certainty shall not prevent the \nproposal from proceeding.

The production and use of DDT shall be eliminated except for Parties that have notified \nthe Secretariat of their intention to produce and/or use it.  A DDT Register is hereby \nestablished and shall be available to the public.  The Secretariat shall maintain the DDT \nRegister. \n\n2. Each Party that produces and/or uses DDT shall restrict such production and/or use for \ndisease vector control in accordance with the World Health Organization recommendations \nand guidelines on the use of DDT and when locally safe, effective and affordable alternatives \nare not available to the Party in question. \n\n3. In the event that a Party not listed in the DDT Register determines that it requires DDT \nfor disease vector control, it shall notify the Secretariat as soon as possible in order to have its \nname added forthwith to the DDT Register.  It shall at the same time notify the World Health \nOrganization.  \n\n4. Every three years, each Party that uses DDT shall provide to the Secretariat and the \nWorld Health Organization information on the amount used, the conditions of such use and its \nrelevance to that Party?s disease management strategy, in a format to be decided by the \nConference of the Parties in consultation with the World Health Organization. \n\n5. With the goal of reducing and ultimately eliminating the use of DDT, the Conference of \nthe Parties shall encourage: \n\n (a) Each Party using DDT to develop and implement an action plan as part of the \nimplementation plan specified in Article 7.

The following industrial source categories have the potential for comparatively high \nformation and release of these chemicals to the environment: \n\n \n (a) Waste incinerators, including co-incinerators of municipal, hazardous or medical \nwaste or of sewage sludge; \n\n \n (b) Cement kilns firing hazardous waste; \n\n \n (c) Production of pulp using elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental \nchlorine for bleaching; \n\n \n (d) The following thermal processes in the metallurgical industry: \n \n\n (i) Secondary copper production; \n \n (ii) Sinter plants in the iron and steel industry; \n  \n (iii) Secondary aluminium production; \n  \n (iv) Secondary zinc production. \n\n \nPart III:  Source categories \n\n \n Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, hexachlorobenzene and \npolychlorinated biphenyls may also be unintentionally formed and released from the \nfollowing source categories, including: \n \n (a) Open burning of waste, including burning of landfill sites; \n \n\n (b) Thermal processes in the metallurgical industry not mentioned in Part II; \n \n\n\n\n 32\n\n (c) Residential combustion sources; \n \n\n(d) Fossil fuel-fired utility and industrial boilers; \n \n (e) Firing installations for wood and other biomass fuels; \n \n\n(f) Specific chemical production processes releasing unintentionally formed \npersistent organic pollutants, especially production of chlorophenols and chloranil; \n \n (g) Crematoria; \n \n (h) Motor vehicles, particularly those burning leaded gasoline; \n \n (i) Destruction of animal carcasses; \n \n (j) Textile and leather dyeing (with chloranil) and finishing (with alkaline \nextraction); \n \n (k) Shredder plants for the treatment of end of life vehicles; \n \n (l) Smouldering of copper cables; \n \n (m) Waste oil refineries. \n \n\nPart IV:  Definitions \n \n1. For the purposes of this Annex: \n \n (a) ?Polychlorinated biphenyls? means aromatic compounds formed in such a manner \nthat the hydrogen atoms on the biphenyl molecule (two benzene rings bonded together by a \nsingle carbon-carbon bond) may be replaced by up to ten chlorine atoms; and \n \n (b) ?Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins? and ?polychlorinated dibenzofurans? are \ntricyclic, aromatic compounds formed by two benzene rings connected by two oxygen atoms \nin polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and by one oxygen atom and one carbon-carbon bond in \npolychlorinated dibenzofurans and the hydrogen atoms of which may be replaced by up to \neight chlorine atoms.  \n \n2. In this Annex, the toxicity of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans is \nexpressed using the concept of toxic equivalency which measures the relative dioxin-like \ntoxic activity of different congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans \nand coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls in comparison to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.  \nThe toxic equivalent factor values to be used for the purposes of this Convention shall be \nconsistent with accepted international standards, commencing with the World Health \nOrganization 1998 mammalian toxic equivalent factor values for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-\ndioxins and dibenzofurans and coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls.  Concentrations are \nexpressed in toxic equivalents. \n\n \n\n\n\n 33\n\nPart V:  General guidance on best available techniques and best environmental practices \n \n This Part provides general guidance to Parties on preventing or reducing releases of the \nchemicals listed in Part I. \n \n\nA.  General prevention measures relating to both best available techniques \n and best environmental practices \n\n \n Priority should be given to the consideration of approaches to prevent the formation and \nrelease of the chemicals listed in Part I.  Useful measures could include: \n \n (a) The use of low-waste technology; \n \n (b) The use of less hazardous substances; \n \n (c) The promotion of the recovery and recycling of waste and of substances \ngenerated and used in a process; \n \n (d) Replacement of feed materials which are persistent organic pollutants or where \nthere is a direct link between the materials and releases of persistent organic pollutants from \nthe source; \n \n (e) Good housekeeping and preventive maintenance programmes; \n \n (f) Improvements in waste management with the aim of the cessation of open and \nother uncontrolled burning of wastes, including the burning of landfill sites.  When \nconsidering proposals to construct new waste disposal facilities, consideration should be \ngiven to alternatives such as activities to minimize the generation of municipal and medical \nwaste, including resource recovery, reuse, recycling, waste separation and promoting products \nthat generate less waste.   Under this approach, public health concerns should be carefully \nconsidered; \n \n (g) Minimization of these chemicals as contaminants in products; \n \n (h) Avoiding elemental chlorine or chemicals generating elemental chlorine for \nbleaching. \n \n\nB.  Best available techniques  \n \n The concept of best available techniques is not aimed at the prescription of any specific \ntechnique or technology, but at taking into account the technical characteristics of the \ninstallation concerned, its geographical location and the local environmental conditions.  \nAppropriate control techniques to reduce releases of the chemicals listed in Part I are in \ngeneral the same.  In determining best available techniques, special consideration should be \ngiven, generally or in specific cases, to the following factors, bearing in mind the likely costs \nand benefits of a measure and consideration of precaution and prevention:   \n  \n (a) General considerations: \n\n \n(i) The nature, effects and mass of the releases concerned:  techniques may \n\nvary depending on source size; \n \n\n\n\n 34\n\n(ii) The commissioning dates for new or existing installations; \n \n(iii) The time needed to introduce the best available technique; \n\n \n(iv) The consumption and nature of raw materials used in the process and its \n\nenergy efficiency; \n \n(v) The need to prevent or reduce to a minimum the overall impact of the \n\nreleases to the environment and the risks to it; \n \n(vi) The need to prevent accidents and to minimize their consequences for the \n\nenvironment; \n \n(vii) The need to ensure occupational health and safety at workplaces; \n \n(viii) Comparable processes, facilities or methods of operation which have been \n\ntried with success on an industrial scale; \n \n(ix) Technological advances and changes in scientific knowledge and \nunderstanding.  \n\n \n  (b) General release reduction measures:  When considering proposals to construct \nnew facilities or significantly modify existing facilities using processes that release chemicals \nlisted in this Annex, priority consideration should be given to alternative processes, \ntechniques or practices that have similar usefulness but which avoid the formation and release \nof such chemicals.  In cases where such facilities will be constructed or significantly \nmodified, in addition to the prevention measures outlined in section A of Part V the following \nreduction measures could also be considered in determining best available techniques: \n \n\n(i) Use of improved methods for flue-gas cleaning such as thermal or catalytic \noxidation, dust precipitation, or adsorption; \n\n \n(ii) Treatment of residuals, wastewater, wastes and sewage sludge by, for \n\nexample, thermal treatment or rendering them inert or chemical processes \nthat detoxify them; \n\n \n(iii) Process changes that lead to the reduction or elimination of releases, such as \n\nmoving to closed systems; \n \n(iv) Modification of process designs to improve combustion and prevent \n\nformation of the chemicals listed in this Annex, through the control of \nparameters such as incineration temperature or residence time. \n\n \n \n\nC.  Best environmental practices  \n \n The Conference of the Parties may develop guidance with regard to best environmental \npractices. \n\n\n\n 35\n\n \nAnnex D \n\n \nINFORMATION REQUIREMENTS AND SCREENING CRITERIA  \n\n \n1. A Party submitting a proposal to list a chemical in Annexes A, B and/or C shall identify \nthe chemical in the manner described in subparagraph (a) and provide the information on the \nchemical, and its transformation products where relevant, relating to the screening criteria set \nout in subparagraphs (b) to (e):  \n \n (a) Chemical identity: \n\n \n (i) Names, including trade name or names, commercial name or names and \n\nsynonyms, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry number, \nInternational Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name; and  \n\n \n (ii) Structure, including specification of isomers, where applicable, and the \n\nstructure of the chemical class; \n \n (b) Persistence: \n \n\n (i) Evidence that the half-life of the chemical in water is greater than two \nmonths, or that its half-life in soil is greater than six months, or that its half-\nlife in sediment is greater than six months; or \n\n \n (ii) Evidence that the chemical is otherwise sufficiently persistent to justify its \n\nconsideration within the scope of this Convention; \n \n (c) Bio-accumulation: \n\n \n (i) Evidence that the bio-concentration factor or bio-accumulation factor in \n\naquatic species for the chemical is greater than 5,000 or, in the absence of \nsuch data, that the log Kow is greater than 5;  \n\n \n (ii) Evidence that a chemical presents other reasons for concern, such as high \n\nbio-accumulation in other species, high toxicity or ecotoxicity; or \n \n (iii) Monitoring data in biota indicating that the bio-accumulation potential of \n\nthe chemical is sufficient to justify its consideration within the scope of this \nConvention; \n\n \n (d) Potential for long-range environmental transport: \n \n\n (i) Measured levels of the chemical in locations distant from the sources of its \nrelease that are of potential concern;  \n\n \n (ii) Monitoring data showing that long-range environmental transport of the \n\nchemical, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment, may \nhave occurred via air, water or migratory species; or \n\n \n (iii) Environmental fate properties and/or model results that demonstrate that the \n\nchemical has a potential for long-range environmental transport through air, \n\n\n\n 36\n\nwater or migratory species, with the potential for transfer to a receiving \nenvironment in locations distant from the sources of its release.

          "Summary of provisions: Article 2 defines strategic environmental impact Each party undertakes to ensure that officials and authorities assist the public in matters covered by this Protocol (art.3.1) and to provide appropriate recognition and support to associations, organisations of groups promoting environmental protection (art.3.2).  The public is to be able to exercise its rights without discrimination  (art.3.7).  Each Party agrees to ensure that a strategic environmental assessment is carried out for plans and programmes prepared inter alia for agriculture, energy and transport, and which are likely to have significant environmental effects (art.4). Parties are to determine whether plans and programmes are likely to have significant environmental effects through a case- by-case examination and/or by specifying types of plans and programmes (art.5.1). Moreover, each Party is to endeavour to provide opportunities for the participation of the public concerned (art.4.3).  Parties are to establish arrangements for the determination of the relevant information to be included in the environmental report (art. 6) which must be prepared for plans and programmes subject to strategic environmental assessments (art.7).  The report is to identify, describe and evaluate the likely significant environmental effects of implementing the plan or programme and its reasonable alternatives (art.7.2). Parties are to ensure early, timely and effective opportunities for public participation, in the strategic environmental assessments when all options are open (art. 8.1).  Article 10 provides for transboundary consultations under certain conditions. The decision to adopt a plan or programme is to take due account of the conclusions of the environmental report as well as the measures to prevent, reduce or mitigate the adverse effects identified therein and the comments received (art. 11).

The following chemical substances of natural and anthropogenic\norigin, not listed in order of priority, are thought to have the\npotential to modify the chemical and physical properties of the\nozone layer.\n\n(a) Carbon substances\n\n(i) Carbon monoxide (CO)\n\nCarbon monoxide has significant natural and\nanthropogenic sources, and is thought to play a major\ndirect role in tropospheric photochemistry, and an\nindirect role in stratospheric photochemistry.\n\n(ii) Carbon dioxide (CO2)\n\nCarbon dioxide has significant natural and anthropogenic\nsources, and affects stratospheric ozone by influencing\nthe thermal structure of the atmosphere.\n\n(iii) Methane (CH4)\n\nMethane has both natural and anthropogenic sources, and\naffects both tropospheric and stratospheric ozone.\n\n(iv) Non-methane hydrocarbon species\n\nNon-methane hydrocarbon species, which consist of a\nlarge number of chemical substances, have both natural\nand anthropogenic sources, and play a direct role in\ntropospheric photochemistry and an indirect role in\nstratospheric photochemistry.\n\n(b) Nitrogen substances\n\n(i) Nitrous oxide (N2O)\n\nThe dominant sources of N2O are natural, but\nanthropogenic contributions are becoming increasingly\nimportant. Nitrous oxide is the primary source of\n\n\n\nThe Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer\n\n20\n\nstratospheric NOX, which play a vital role in controlling\nthe abundance of stratospheric ozone.\n\n(ii) Nitrogen oxides (NOX)\n\nGround-level sources of NOX play a major direct role only\nin tropospheric photochemical processes and an indirect\nrole in stratosphere photochemistry, whereas injection of\nNOX close to the tropopause may lead directly to a change\nin upper tropospheric and stratospheric ozone.\n\n(c) Chlorine substances\n\n(i) Fully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CCl4, CFCl3 (CFC?11),\nCF2Cl2 (CFC?12), C2F3Cl3 (CFC?113), C2F4Cl2 (CFC?\n114)\n\nFully halogenated alkanes are anthropogenic and act as a\nsource of ClOX which plays a vital role in ozone\nphotochemistry, especially in the 30?50 km altitude\nregion.\n\n(ii) Partially halogenated alkanes, e.g. CH3Cl, CHF2Cl\n(CFC?22), CH3CCl3, CHFCl2 (CFC?21)\n\nThe sources of CH3Cl are natural, whereas the other\npartially halogenated alkanes mentioned above are\nanthropogenic in origin. These gases also act as a source\nof stratospheric ClOX.\n\n(d) Bromine substances\n\nFully halogenated alkanes, e.g. CF3Br\n\nThese gases are anthropogenic and act as a source of\nBrOX, which behaves in a manner similar to ClOX.\n\n(e) Hydrogen substances\n\n(i) Hydrogen (H2)\n\nHydrogen, the source of which is natural and\nanthropogenic, plays a minor role in stratospheric\nphotochemistry.\n\n(ii) Water (H2O)\n\n\n\nThe Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer\n\n21\n\nWater, the source of which is natural, plays a vital role in\nboth tropospheric and stratospheric photochemistry.\nLocal sources of water vapor in the stratosphere include\nthe oxidation of methane and, to a lesser extent, of\nhydrogen.\n\n\n\nThe Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer\n\n22\n\nAnnex II: Information exchange\n1. The Parties to the Convention recognize that the collection and\n\nsharing of information is an important means of implementing the\nobjectives of this Convention and of assuring that any actions that\nmay be taken are appropriate and equitable. Therefore, Parties shall\nexchange scientific, technical, socio-economic, business,\ncommercial and legal information.\n\n2. The Parties to the Convention, in deciding what information is to be\ncollected and exchanged, should take into account the usefulness of\nthe information and the costs of obtaining it.

The delegations of Australia, Austria Belgium, Canada, Chile,\nDenmark, Finland, France, Germany, Federal Republic of, Italy,\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland express\ntheir regret at the absence from the Vienna Convention for the\nProtection of the Ozone Layer of any provision for the compulsory\nsettlement of disputes by third parties, at the request of one party.\nConsistently with their traditional support for such a procedure,\nthese delegations appeal to all Parties to the Convention to make use\nof the possibility of a declaration under article 11, paragraph 3, of\nthe Convention.\n\n2. The delegation of Egypt reiterates the importance attached by its\nGovernment to the international and national efforts to protect the\nenvironment, including the protection of the ozone layer.  For that\nreason, it has participated from the outset in the preparatory work\nfor the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Protection of the\nOzone Layer, and in the adoption of the Convention and\nresolutions.  While concurring with the consensus on article 1 of the\nConvention, the delegation of Egypt understands paragraph 6 of\nthat article as being applicable to all regional organizations,\nincluding the Organization of African Unity and the League of Arab\nStates, provided they fulfil the conditions laid down in that article,\nnamely, that they have competence in respect of matters governed\nby the Convention and have been duly authorized by their member\nStates in accordance with their internal rules of procedure.  While\nconcurring with the consensus on article 2 of the Convention, the\ndelegation of Egypt states that the first sentence of paragraph 2 of\nthat article should be read in the light of the third preambular\nparagraph.  While concurring with the consensus on Resolution No.\n\n                                               \nX/ The Conference agreed that the declarations contained in paragraphs 1\n\nto 3, as submitted on 21 March 1985, and the declarations contained in\nparagraphs 4 and 5, as submitted on 22 March 1985, should be\nappended to the Final Act.\n\n\n\nThe Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer\n\n25\n\n1 on Institutional and Financial Arrangements, the delegation of\nEgypt states that its approval of the third preambular paragraph of\nthat resolution is without prejudice to its position on the method of\napportioning contributions among the member States, with\nparticular reference to option 2, which it had supported during the\ndiscussions on preparatory document UNEP/WG.94/13, whereby 80\nper cent of the costs would be covered by the industrialized\ncountries and the remaining 20 per cent apportioned among the\nmember States on the basis of the United Nations scale of\nassessment.\n\n3. With regard to Resolution No. 2 on the Protocol Concerning\nChlorofluorocarbons, the delegation of Japan is of the opinion that a\ndecision whether or not to continue work on a protocol should await\nthe results of the work of the Co-ordinating Committee on the\nOzone Layer.  Secondly, with regard to paragraph 6 of the above-\nmentioned resolution, the delegation of Japan is of the opinion that\neach country should itself decide how to control emissions of\nchlorofluorocarbons.\n\n4. The delegation of Spain declares that, in accordance with the\ninterpretation by the President of the Conference in his statement of\n21 March 1985, its Government understands paragraph 6 of the\nResolution on a Protocol Concerning Chlorofluorocarbons as being\naddressed exclusively to the individual countries themselves, which\nare urged to control their limits of production or use, and not to\nthird countries or to regional organizations with respect to such\ncountries.\n\n5. The delegation of the United States of America declares that it\nunderstands article 15 of the Convention to mean that regional\neconomic integration organizations, none of whose member States\nare Parties to the Convention or relevant Protocol, shall have one\nvote each.  It further understands that article 15 does not allow any\ndouble voting by regional economic integration organizations and\ntheir member States, that is, regional economic integration\norganizations may never vote in addition to their member States\nwhich are party to the Convention or relevant protocol, and vice\nversa.\n\n\n\nThis publication contains the text of the Vienna Convention for the\nProtection of the Ozone Layer as adopted by 28 countries on 22 March\n1985 at the Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Protection of the Ozone\nLayer and as deposited with the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\n\nThe Vienna Convention encourages intergovernmental cooperation on\nscientific research, systematic observation of the ozone layer, monitoring of\nCFC production and the exchange of information. Although it contained\nno commitment to take any action to reduce CFC production or\nconsumption, the Vienna Convention was nevertheless an important\nmilestone: nations agreed in principle to tackle  a global environmental\nproblem before its effects were felt or its existence scientifically proven,\nprobably the first example of the acceptance of the ?precautionary\nprinciple? in a major international negotiation. Also, the important 1987\nMontreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was\nnegotiated under this Convention.\n\nThe Vienna Convention continues to give guidance on the monitoring,\ncalibration and archiving of measurements of stratospheric and\ntropospheric ozone, and of vertical ozone profiles, UV-B radiation, other\natmospheric trace species and aerosols. It gives guidance also on the\nrelated research activities that are essential to understanding the problem\nof ozone-layer depletion and the interactions between the ozone layer and\nclimate.\n\nAs of November 2001, 184 Parties had ratified the Vienna Convention.\n\nOzone Secretariat\nUnited Nations Environment Programme\n\nP.

The Parties included in Annex I shall, individually or jointly, ensure that their aggregate \nanthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of the greenhouse gases listed in Annex A \ndo not exceed their assigned amounts, calculated pursuant to their quantified emission limitation \nand reduction commitments inscribed in Annex B and in accordance with the provisions of this \nArticle, with a view to reducing their overall emissions of such gases by at least 5 per cent \nbelow 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008 to 2012. \n\n2. Each Party included in Annex I shall, by 2005, have made demonstrable progress in \nachieving its commitments under this Protocol. \n\n3. The net changes in greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks resulting \nfrom direct human-induced land-use change and forestry activities, limited to afforestation, \nreforestation and deforestation since 1990, measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks in \neach commitment period, shall be used to meet the commitments under this Article of each Party \nincluded in Annex I.  The greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks associated \nwith those activities shall be reported in a transparent and verifiable manner and reviewed in \naccordance with Articles 7 and 8. \n\n4. Prior to the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the \nParties to this Protocol, each Party included in Annex I shall provide, for consideration by the \nSubsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, data to establish its level of carbon \nstocks in 1990 and to enable an estimate to be made of its changes in carbon stocks in \nsubsequent years.  The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this \nProtocol shall, at its first session or as soon as practicable thereafter, decide upon modalities, \nrules and guidelines as to how, and which, additional human-induced activities related to \nchanges in greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks in the agricultural soils \nand the land-use change and forestry categories shall be added to, or subtracted from, the \nassigned amounts for Parties included in Annex I, taking into account uncertainties, transparency \nin reporting, verifiability, the methodological work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, the advice provided by the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice in \naccordance with Article 5 and the decisions of the Conference of the Parties.  Such a decision \nshall apply in the second and subsequent commitment periods.  A Party may choose to apply \nsuch a decision on these additional human-induced activities for its first commitment period, \nprovided that these activities have taken place since 1990. \n\n\n\n- 4 - \n\n5. The Parties included in Annex I undergoing the process of transition to a market \neconomy whose base year or period was established pursuant to decision 9/CP.2 of the \nConference of the Parties at its second session shall use that base year or period for the \nimplementation of their commitments under this Article.  Any other Party included in Annex I \nundergoing the process of transition to a market economy which has not yet submitted its first \nnational communication under Article 12 of the Convention may also notify the Conference \nof the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Protocol that it intends to use an \nhistorical base year or period other than 1990 for the implementation of its commitments under \nthis Article.  The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Protocol \nshall decide on the acceptance of such notification. \n\n6. Taking into account Article 4, paragraph 6, of the Convention, in the implementation of \ntheir commitments under this Protocol other than those under this Article, a certain degree of \nflexibility shall be allowed by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties \nto this Protocol to the Parties included in Annex I undergoing the process of transition to a \nmarket economy. \n\n7. In the first quantified emission limitation and reduction commitment period, from 2008 \nto 2012, the assigned amount for each Party included in Annex I shall be equal to the percentage \ninscribed for it in Annex B of its aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions \nof the greenhouse gases listed in Annex A in 1990, or the base year or period determined in \naccordance with paragraph 5 above, multiplied by five.  Those Parties included in Annex I \nfor whom land-use change and forestry constituted a net source of greenhouse gas emissions \nin 1990 shall include in their 1990 emissions base year or period the aggregate anthropogenic \ncarbon dioxide equivalent emissions by sources minus removals by sinks in 1990 from land-use \nchange for the purposes of calculating their assigned amount. \n\n8. Any Party included in Annex I may use 1995 as its base year for hydrofluorocarbons, \nperfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride, for the purposes of the calculation referred to in \nparagraph 7 above. \n\n9. Commitments for subsequent periods for Parties included in Annex I shall be established \nin amendments to Annex B to this Protocol, which shall be adopted in accordance with the \nprovisions of Article 21, paragraph 7.  The Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of \nthe Parties to this Protocol shall initiate the consideration of such commitments at least \nseven years before the end of the first commitment period referred to in paragraph 1 above. \n\n10. Any emission reduction units, or any part of an assigned amount, which a Party acquires \nfrom another Party in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 or of Article 17 shall be added \nto the assigned amount for the acquiring Party. \n\n11. Any emission reduction units, or any part of an assigned amount, which a Party transfers \nto another Party in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 or of Article 17 shall be \nsubtracted from the assigned amount for the transferring Party. \n\n12. Any certified emission reductions which a Party acquires from another Party in \naccordance with the provisions of Article 12 shall be added to the assigned amount for the \nacquiring Party. \n\n\n\n- 5 - \n\n13. If the emissions of a Party included in Annex I in a commitment period are less than its \nassigned amount under this Article, this difference shall, on request of that Party, be added to the \nassigned amount for that Party for subsequent commitment periods. \n\n14. Each Party included in Annex I shall strive to implement the commitments mentioned in \nparagraph 1 above in such a way as to minimize adverse social, environmental and economic \nimpacts on developing country Parties, particularly those identified in Article 4, paragraphs 8 \nand 9, of the Convention.  In line with relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties on the \nimplementation of those paragraphs, the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the \nParties to this Protocol shall, at its first session, consider what actions are necessary to minimize \nthe adverse effects of climate change and/or the impacts of response measures on Parties referred \nto in those paragraphs.  Among the issues to be considered shall be the establishment of funding, \ninsurance and transfer of technology. \n\nArticle 4 \n\n1. Any Parties included in Annex I that have reached an agreement to fulfil their \ncommitments under Article 3 jointly, shall be deemed to have met those commitments provided \nthat their total combined aggregate anthropogenic carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of the \ngreenhouse gases listed in Annex A do not exceed their assigned amounts calculated pursuant to \ntheir quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments inscribed in Annex B and in \naccordance with the provisions of Article 3.  The respective emission level allocated to each of \nthe Parties to the agreement shall be set out in that agreement. \n\n2. The Parties to any such agreement shall notify the secretariat of the terms of the \nagreement on the date of deposit of their instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval \nof this Protocol, or accession thereto.  The secretariat shall in turn inform the Parties and \nsignatories to the Convention of the terms of the agreement. \n\n3. Any such agreement shall remain in operation for the duration of the commitment period \nspecified in Article 3, paragraph 7. \n\n4. If Parties acting jointly do so in the framework of, and together with, a regional economic \nintegration organization, any alteration in the composition of the organization after adoption of \nthis Protocol shall not affect existing commitments under this Protocol.  Any alteration in the \ncomposition of the organization shall only apply for the purposes of those commitments under \nArticle 3 that are adopted subsequent to that alteration. \n\n5. In the event of failure by the Parties to such an agreement to achieve their total combined \nlevel of emission reductions, each Party to that agreement shall be responsible for its own level \nof emissions set out in the agreement. \n\n6. If Parties acting jointly do so in the framework of, and together with, a regional economic \nintegration organization which is itself a Party to this Protocol, each member State of that \nregional economic integration organization individually, and together with the regional economic \nintegration organization acting in accordance with Article 24, shall, in the event of failure to \nachieve the total combined level of emission reductions, be responsible for its level of emissions \nas notified in accordance with this Article. \n\n\n\n- 6 - \n\nArticle 5 \n\n1. Each Party included in Annex I shall have in place, no later than one year prior to the \nstart of the first commitment period, a national system for the estimation of anthropogenic \nemissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the \nMontreal Protocol.  Guidelines for such national systems, which shall incorporate the \nmethodologies specified in paragraph 2 below, shall be decided upon by the Conference of \nthe Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Protocol at its first session. \n\n2. Methodologies for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks \nof all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol shall be those accepted by the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties \nat its third session.  Where such methodologies are not used, appropriate adjustments shall be \napplied according to methodologies agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties serving as the \nmeeting of the Parties to this Protocol at its first session.

It entered into force \non 29 December 1993. Today, the Convention is the main international instrument\nfor addressing biodiversity issues.  It provides a comprehensive and holistic\napproach to the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of natural\nresources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits deriving from the use of\ngenetic resources.\nBiosafety is one of the issues addressed by the Convention. This concept refers to\nthe need to protect human health and the environment from the possible adverse\neffects of the products of modern biotechnology.  At the same time, modern\nbiotechnology is recognized as having a great potential for the promotion of\nhuman well-being, particularly in meeting critical needs for food, agriculture and\nhealth care.  The Convention clearly recognizes these twin aspects of modern\nbiotechnology.  On the one hand, it provides for the access to and transfer of\ntechnologies, including biotechnology, that are relevant to the conservation and\nsustainable use of biological diversity (for example, in Article 16, paragragh 1,\nand Article 19, paragraphs 1 and 2).  On the other hand, Articles 8(g) and 19,\nparagraph 3, seek to ensure the development of appropriate procedures to enhance\nthe safety of biotechnology in the context of the Convention?s overall goal of\nreducing all potential threats to biological diversity, taking also into account the\nrisks to human health.  Article 8(g) deals with measures that Parties should take at\nnational level, while Article 19, paragraph 3, sets the stage for the development of\nan international legally binding instrument to address the issue of biosafety.\nAt its second meeting, held in November 1995, the Conference of the Parties to the\nConvention established an Open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on Biosafety to\ndevelop a draft protocol on biosafety, focusing specifically on transboundary\nmovement of any living modified organism resulting from modern biotechnology\nthat may have adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological\ndiversity.  After several years of negotiations, the Protocol, known as the Cartagena\nProtocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, was finalized and\nadopted in Montreal on 29 January 2000 at an extraordinary meeting of the\nConference of the Parties.\nThe conclusion of the Biosafety Protocol has been hailed as a significant step\nforward in that it provides an international regulatory framework to reconcile the\nrespective needs of trade and environmental protection with respect to a rapidly\ngrowing global industry, the biotechnology industry.  The Protocol thus creates \nan enabling environment for the environmentally sound application of\nbiotechnology, making it possible to derive maximum benefit from the potential\nthat biotechnology has to offer, while minimizing the possible risks to the\nenvironment and to human health. \n\n1\n\nCartagena Protocol on Biosafety\n\nMontreal, 2000\nCopyright ? 2000, Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity\nISBN: 92-807-1924-6\n\nThis publication may be reproduced for educational or non-profit purposes without\nspecial permission from the copyright holders, provided acknowledgement of the\nsource is made.

The objective of risk assessment, under this Protocol, is to identify and\nevaluate the potential adverse effects of living modified organisms on the\nconservation and sustainable use of biological diversity in the likely potential\nreceiving environment, taking also into account risks to human health.\n\nUse of risk assessment\n2. Risk assessment is, inter alia, used by competent authorities to make\ninformed decisions regarding living modified organisms.\n\nGeneral principles\n3. Risk assessment should be carried out in a scientifically sound and\ntransparent manner, and can take into account expert advice of, and guidelines\ndeveloped by, relevant international organizations.\n4. Lack of scientific knowledge or scientific consensus should not necessarily\nbe interpreted as indicating a particular level of risk, an absence of risk, or an\nacceptable risk.\n5. Risks associated with living modified organisms or products thereof,\nnamely, processed materials that are of living modified organism origin,\ncontaining detectable novel combinations of replicable genetic material\nobtained through the use of modern biotechnology, should be considered in the\ncontext of the risks posed by the non-modified recipients or parental organisms\nin the likely potential receiving environment.\n6. Risk assessment should be carried out on a case-by-case basis. The required\ninformation may vary in nature and level of detail from case to case, depending\non the living modified organism concerned, its intended use and the likely\npotential receiving environment.\n\nMethodology\n7. The process of risk assessment may on the one hand give rise to a need for\nfurther information about specific subjects, which may be identified and\nrequested during the assessment process, while on the other hand information\non other subjects may not be relevant in some instances.\n8. To fulfil its objective, risk assessment entails, as appropriate, the following\nsteps:\n\n(a) An identification of any novel genotypic and phenotypic characteristics\nassociated with the living modified organism that may have adverse effects on\nbiological diversity in the likely potential receiving environment, taking also\ninto account risks to human health; \n\n(b) An evaluation of the likelihood of these adverse effects being realized,\ntaking into account the level and kind of exposure of the likely potential\nreceiving environment to the living modified organism; \n\n(c) An evaluation of the consequences should these adverse effects be\nrealized; \n\n(d) An estimation of the overall risk posed by the living modified organism\nbased on the evaluation of the likelihood and consequences of the identified\nadverse effects being realized; \n\n(e) A recommendation as to whether or not the risks are acceptable or\nmanageable, including, where necessary, identification of strategies to manage\nthese risks; and \n\n(f) Where there is uncertainty regarding the level of risk, it may be\naddressed by requesting further information on the specific issues of concern or\nby implementing appropriate risk management strategies and/or monitoring the\nl iving modified organism in the re c e iving env i ro n m e n t .\n\nPoints to consider\n9. Depending on the case, risk assessment takes into account the relevant\ntechnical and scientific details regarding the characteristics of the following\nsubjects:\n\n(a) Recipient organism or parental organisms. The biological characteristics\nof the recipient organism or parental organisms, including information on\ntaxonomic status, common name, origin, centres of origin and centres of\ngenetic diversity, if known, and a description of the habitat where the organisms\nmay persist or proliferate; \n\n(b) Donor organism or organisms. Taxonomic status and common name,\nsource, and the relevant biological characteristics of the donor organisms; \n\n28 29\n\nCartagena Protocol on Biosafety Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety\n\nProto/ang  11/13/2000  3:39 PM  Page 28\n\n\n\n(c) Vector. Characteristics of the vector, including its identity, if any, and its\nsource or origin, and its host range; \n\n(d) Insert or inserts and/or characteristics of modification. Genetic\ncharacteristics of the inserted nucleic acid and the function it specifies, and/or\ncharacteristics of the modification introduced; \n\n(e) Living modified organism. Identity of the living modified organism, and\nthe differences between the biological characteristics of the living modified\norganism and those of the recipient organism or parental organisms; \n\n(f) Detection and identification of the living modified organism. Suggested\ndetection and identification methods and their specificity, sensitivity and\nreliability; \n\n(g) Information relating to the intended use. Information relating to the\nintended use of the living modified organism, including new or changed use\ncompared to the recipient organism or parental organisms; and\n\n(h) Receiving environment. Information on the location, geographical,\nclimatic and ecological characteristics, including relevant information on\nbiological diversity and centres of origin of the likely potential receiving\nenvironment. \n\n30\n\nCartagena Protocol on Biosafety\n\nProto/ang  11/13/2000  3:39 PM  Page 30\n\n\n\nPrinted on recycled paper \nat ICAO, Canada\n\nOctober 2000\n\nProto/ang  11/13/2000  3:39 PM  Page 32"],

Only the text of the Convention \nas kept in the custody of the Secretary-General of the United Nations in his capacity as \nDepositary constitutes the authentic version of the Convention, as modified by any \namendments and/or corrections thereto. This publication is issued for information \npurposes only.  \n2 The Conference of the Parties adopted Decision III/1 at its third meeting to amend the \nConvention by adding, inter alia, a new preambular paragraph 7 bis.  The amendment is \nnot yet in force.  The relevant part of Decision III/1 provides as follows: \n \n?The Conference \n ? \n\n3. Decides to adopt the following amendment to the Convention: \n \n\n ?Insert new preambular paragraph 7 bis: \n \n\nRecognizing that transboundary movements of hazardous wastes, especially to \ndeveloping countries, have a high risk of not constituting an environmentally \nsound management of hazardous wastes as required by this Convention; \n\n ??? \n\n\n\n 3\n\nincluding their transboundary movement and disposal is consistent with \nthe protection of human health and the environment whatever the place \nof disposal, \n\n Noting that States should ensure that the generator should \ncarry out duties with regard to the transport and disposal of hazardous \nwastes and other wastes in a manner that is consistent with the \nprotection of the environment, whatever the place of disposal, \n\n Fully recognizing that any State has the sovereign right to ban \nthe entry or disposal of foreign hazardous wastes and other wastes in its \nterritory, \n\n Recognizing also the increasing desire for the prohibition of \ntransboundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal in \nother States, especially developing countries, \n\n Convinced that hazardous wastes and other wastes should, as \nfar as is compatible with environmentally sound and efficient \nmanagement, be disposed of in the State where they were generated, \n\n Aware also that transboundary movements of such wastes \nfrom the State of their generation to any other State should be permitted \nonly when conducted under conditions which do not endanger human \nhealth and the environment, and under conditions in conformity with \nthe provisions of this Convention, \n\n Considering that enhanced control of transboundary movement \nof hazardous wastes and other wastes will act as an incentive for their \nenvironmentally sound management and for the reduction of the volume \nof such transboundary movement, \n\n Convinced that States should take measures for the proper \nexchange of information on and control of the transboundary movement \nof hazardous wastes and other wastes from and to those States, \n\n Noting that a number of international and regional agreements \nhave addressed the issue of protection and preservation of the \nenvironment with regard to the transit of dangerous goods, \n\n Taking into account the Declaration of the United Nations \nConference on the Human Environment (Stockholm, 1972), the Cairo \nGuidelines and Principles for the Environmentally Sound Management \nof Hazardous Wastes adopted by the Governing Council of the United \nNations Environment Programme (UNEP) by decision 14/30 of 17 June \n\n\n\n 4\n\n1987, the Recommendations of the United Nations Committee of \nExperts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (formulated in 1957 and \nupdated biennially), relevant recommendations, declarations, \ninstruments and regulations adopted within the United Nations system \nand the work and studies done within other international and regional \norganizations, \n\n Mindful of the spirit, principles, aims and functions of the \nWorld Charter for Nature adopted by the General Assembly of the \nUnited Nations at its thirty-seventh session (1982) as the rule of ethics \nin respect of the protection of the human environment and the \nconservation of natural resources, \n\n Affirming that States are responsible for the fulfilment of their \ninternational obligations concerning the protection of human health and \nprotection and preservation of the environment, and are liable in \naccordance with international law, \n\n Recognizing that in the case of a material breach of the \nprovisions of this Convention or any protocol thereto the relevant \ninternational law of treaties shall apply, \n\n Aware of the need to continue the development and \nimplementation of environmentally sound low-waste technologies, \nrecycling options, good house-keeping and management systems with a \nview to reducing to a minimum the generation of hazardous wastes and \nother wastes, \n\n Aware also of the growing international concern about the \nneed for stringent control of transboundary movement of hazardous \nwastes and other wastes, and of the need as far as possible to reduce \nsuch movement to a minimum, \n\n Concerned about the problem of illegal transboundary traffic \nin hazardous wastes and other wastes, \n\n Taking into account also the limited capabilities of the \ndeveloping countries to manage hazardous wastes and other wastes, \n\n Recognizing the need to promote the transfer of technology for \nthe sound management of hazardous wastes and other wastes produced \nlocally, particularly to the developing countries in accordance with the \nspirit of the Cairo Guidelines and decision 14/16 of the Governing \n\n\n\n 5\n\nCouncil of UNEP on Promotion of the transfer of environmental \nprotection technology, \n\n Recognizing also that hazardous wastes and other wastes \nshould be transported in accordance with relevant international \nconventions and recommendations, \n\n Convinced also that the transboundary movement of hazardous \nwastes and other wastes should be permitted only when the transport \nand the ultimate disposal of such wastes is environmentally sound, and \n\n Determined to protect, by strict control, human health and the \nenvironment against the adverse effects which may result from the \ngeneration and management of hazardous wastes and other wastes, \n\n \n\nHAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS: \n\nARTICLE 1 \nScope of the Convention \n\n1. The following wastes that are subject to transboundary \nmovement shall be ?hazardous wastes? for the purposes of this \nConvention: \n\n (a) Wastes that belong to any category contained in \nAnnex I, unless they do not possess any of the characteristics contained \nin Annex III; and \n\n (b)  Wastes that are not covered under paragraph (a) but \nare defined as, or are considered to be, hazardous wastes by the \ndomestic legislation of the Party of export, import or transit. \n\n2.

Flammable liquids are liquids, or \nmixtures of liquids, or liquids containing solids in \nsolution or suspension (for example, paints, \nvarnishes, lacquers, etc., but not including \nsubstances or wastes otherwise classified on account \nof their dangerous characteristics) which give off a \nflammable vapour at temperatures of not more than \n60.5?C, closed-cup test, or not more than 65.6?C, \nopen-cup test.  (Since the results of open-cup tests \nand of closed-cup tests are not strictly comparable \nand even individual results by the same test are often \nvariable, regulations varying from the above figures \nto make allowance for such differences would be \nwithin the spirit of this definition.) \n\n4.1  H4.1  Flammable solids \n\n_________________________________ \n5 Corresponds to the hazard classification system included in the United Nations \nRecommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods (ST/SG/AC.10/1Rev.5, United \nNations, New York, 1988). \n\n\n\n 39\n\n  Solids, or waste solids, other than those classed as \nexplosives, which under conditions encountered in \ntransport are readily combustible, or may cause or \ncontribute to fire through friction. \n\n4.2  H4.2  Substances or wastes liable to spontaneous \ncombustion \n\n  Substances or wastes which are liable to \nspontaneous heating under normal conditions \nencountered in transport, or to heating up on contact \nwith air, and being then liable to catch fire.  \n\n4.3  H4.3  Substances or wastes which, in contact with water \nemit flammable gases \n\n  Substances or wastes which, by interaction with \nwater, are liable to become spontaneously \nflammable or to give off flammable gases in \ndangerous quantities. \n\n5.1  H5.1  Oxidizing \n\n  Substances or wastes which, while in themselves not \nnecessarily combustible, may, generally by yielding \noxygen cause, or contribute to, the combustion of \nother materials. \n\n5.2 H5.2  Organic Peroxides \n\n  Organic substances or wastes which contain the \nbivalent-o-o-structure are thermally unstable \nsubstances which may undergo exothermic self-\naccelerating decomposition. \n\n6.1  H6.1  Poisonous (Acute) \n\n  Substances or wastes liable either to cause death or \nserious injury or to harm human health if swallowed \n\n\n\n 40\n\nor inhaled or by skin contact. \n\n6.2  H6.2 Infectious substances \n\n  Substances or wastes containing viable micro \norganisms or their toxins which are known or \nsuspected to cause disease in animals or humans. \n\n8 H8  Corrosives \n\n  Substances or wastes which, by chemical action, \nwill cause severe damage when in contact with \nliving tissue, or, in the case of leakage, will \nmaterially damage, or even destroy, other goods or \nthe means of transport; they may also cause other \nhazards. \n\n9  H10  Liberation of toxic gases in contact with air or water \n\n  Substances or wastes which, by interaction with air \nor water, are liable to give off toxic gases in \ndangerous quantities. \n\n9  H11  Toxic (Delayed or chronic) \n\n  Substances or wastes which, if they are inhaled or \ningested or if they penetrate the skin, may involve \ndelayed or chronic effects, including \ncarcinogenicity. \n\n9 H12  Ecotoxic \n\n  Substances or wastes which if released present or \nmay present immediate or delayed adverse impacts \nto the environment by means of bioaccumulation \nand/or toxic effects upon biotic systems. \n\n9  H13  Capable, by any means, after disposal, of yielding \nanother material, e.g., leachate, which possesses any \n\n\n\n 41\n\nof the characteristics listed above. \n\n \nTests \n\n The potential hazards posed by certain types of wastes are not \nyet fully documented; tests to define quantitatively these hazards do not \nexist.  Further research is necessary in order to develop means to \ncharacterise potential hazards posed to man and/or the environment by \nthese wastes.  Standardized tests have been derived with respect to pure \nsubstances and materials.  Many countries have developed national tests \nwhich can be applied to materials listed in Annex I, in order to decide if \nthese materials exhibit any of the characteristics listed in this Annex. \n\n \n\n\n\n 42\n\n \nANNEX IV \n\nDISPOSAL OPERATIONS \nA.

DEFINITION OF THE CULTURAL AND NATURAL HERITAGE \n\nArticle 1 \n\nFor the purpose of this Convention, the following shall be considered as \"cultural heritage\":  \n \n monuments: architectural works, works of monumental sculpture and painting, \n\nelements or structures of an archaeological nature, inscriptions, cave dwellings and \ncombinations of features, which are of outstanding universal value from the point of \nview of history, art or science; \n\n \n groups of buildings: groups of separate or connected buildings which, because of \n\ntheir architecture, their homogeneity or their place in the landscape, are of \noutstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science; \n\n \n sites: works of man or the combined works of nature and man, and areas including \n\narchaeological sites which are of outstanding universal value from the historical, \naesthetic, ethnological or anthropological point of view. \n\nArticle 2 \n\nFor the purposes of this Convention, the following shall be considered as \"natural heritage\": \n \n natural features consisting of physical and biological formations or groups of such \n\nformations, which are of outstanding universal value from the aesthetic or scientific \npoint of view; \n\n \n geological and physiographical formations and precisely delineated areas which \n\nconstitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants of outstanding \nuniversal value from the point of view of science or conservation; \n\n \n natural sites or precisely delineated natural areas of outstanding universal value from \n\nthe point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty. \n\n\n\n3 \n\nArticle 3 \n\nIt is for each State Party to this Convention to identify and delineate the different properties \nsituated on its territory mentioned in Articles 1 and 2 above. \n \n\nII. NATIONAL PROTECTION AND INTERNATIONAL PROTECTION OF THE \nCULTURAL AND NATURAL HERITAGE \n\nArticle 4 \n\nEach State Party to this Convention recognizes that the duty of ensuring the identification, \nprotection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the cultural \nand natural heritage referred to in Articles 1 and 2 and situated on its territory, belongs \nprimarily to that State. It will do all it can to this end, to the utmost of its own resources and, \nwhere appropriate, with any international assistance and co-operation, in particular, financial, \nartistic, scientific and technical, which it may be able to obtain. \n\nArticle 5 \n\nTo ensure that effective and active measures are taken for the protection, conservation and \npresentation of the cultural and natural heritage situated on its territory, each State Party to \nthis Convention shall endeavor, in so far as possible, and as appropriate for each country: \n \n\n(a) to adopt a general policy which aims to give the cultural and natural heritage a \nfunction in the life of the community and to integrate the protection of that heritage \ninto comprehensive planning programmes; \n\n \n(b) to set up within its territories, where such services do not exist, one or more services \n\nfor the protection, conservation and presentation of the cultural and natural heritage \nwith an appropriate staff and possessing the means to discharge their functions; \n\n \n(c) to develop scientific and technical studies and research and to work out such \n\noperating methods as will make the State capable of counteracting the dangers that \nthreaten its cultural or natural heritage; \n\n \n(d) to take the appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial \n\nmeasures necessary for the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and \nrehabilitation of this heritage; and \n\n \n\n\n\n4 \n\n(e) to foster the establishment or development of national or regional centres for \ntraining in the protection, conservation and presentation of the cultural and natural \nheritage and to encourage scientific research in this field. \n\nArticle 6 \n\n1. Whilst fully respecting the sovereignty of the States on whose territory the cultural \nand natural heritage mentioned in Articles 1 and 2 is situated, and without prejudice \nto property right provided by national legislation, the States Parties to this \nConvention recognize that such heritage constitutes a world heritage for whose \nprotection it is the duty of the international community as a whole to co-operate. \n\n2. The States Parties undertake, in accordance with the provisions of this Convention, to \ngive their help in the identification, protection, conservation and presentation of the \ncultural and natural heritage referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 11 if the \nStates on whose territory it is situated so request. \n\n \n3. Each State Party to this Convention undertakes not to take any deliberate measures \n\nwhich might damage directly or indirectly the cultural and natural heritage referred to \nin Articles 1 and 2 situated on the territory of other States Parties to this Convention. \n\nArticle 7 \n\nFor the purpose of this Convention, international protection of the world cultural and natural \nheritage shall be understood to mean the establishment of a system of international co-\noperation and assistance designed to support States Parties to the Convention in their efforts \nto conserve and identify that heritage. \n\nIII INTERGOVERNMENTAL COMMITTEE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE \nWORLD CULTURAL AND NATURAL HERITAGE \n\nArticle 8 \n\n1. An Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the Cultural and Natural \nHeritage of Outstanding Universal Value, called \"the World Heritage Committee\", is \nhereby established within the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization. It shall be composed of 15 States Parties to the Convention, elected by \nStates Parties to the Convention meeting in general assembly during the ordinary \nsession of the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization. The number of States members of the Committee shall be \nincreased to 21 as from the date of the ordinary session of the General Conference \nfollowing the entry into force of this Convention for at least 40 States. \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n2.  Election of members of the Committee shall ensure an equitable representation of the \n\ndifferent regions and cultures of the world. \n \n3. A representative of the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and \n\nRestoration of Cultural Property (Rome Centre), a representative of the International \nCouncil of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and a representative of the International \nUnion for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), to whom may be \nadded, at the request of States Parties to the Convention meeting in general assembly \nduring the ordinary sessions of the General Conference of the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, representatives of other \nintergovernmental or non-governmental organizations, with similar objectives, may \nattend the meetings of the Committee in an advisory capacity. \n\nArticle 9 \n\n1. The term of office of States members of the World Heritage Committee shall extend \nfrom the end of the ordinary session of the General Conference during which they are \nelected until the end of its third subsequent ordinary session. \n\n \n2. The term of office of one-third of the members designated at the time of the first \n\nelection shall, however, cease at the end of the first ordinary session of the General \nConference following that at which they were elected; and the term of office of a \nfurther third of the members designated at the same time shall cease at the end of the \nsecond ordinary session of the General Conference following that at which they were \nelected. The names of these members shall be chosen by lot by the President of the \nGeneral Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization after the first election. \n\n \n3. States members of the Committee shall choose as their representatives persons \n\nqualified in the field of the cultural or natural heritage. \n\nArticle 10 \n\n1. The World Heritage Committee shall adopt its Rules of Procedure. \n \n2. The Committee may at any time invite public or private organizations or individuals \n\nto participate in its meetings for consultation on particular problems. \n \n3. The Committee may create such consultative bodies as it deems necessary for the \n\nperformance of its functions. \n\n\n\n6 \n\nArticle 11 \n\n1. Every State Party to this Convention shall, in so far as possible, submit to the World \nHeritage Committee an inventory of property forming part of the cultural and natural \nheritage, situated in its territory and suitable for inclusion in the list provided for in \nparagraph 2 of this Article. This inventory, which shall not be considered exhaustive, \nshall include documentation about the location of the property in question and its \nsignificance. \n\n \n2. On the basis of the inventories submitted by States in accordance with paragraph 1, \n\nthe Committee shall establish, keep up to date and publish, under the title of \"World \nHeritage List,\" a list of properties forming part of the cultural heritage and natural \nheritage, as defined in Articles 1 and 2 of this Convention, which it considers as \nhaving outstanding universal value in terms of such criteria as it shall have \nestablished. An updated list shall be distributed at least every two years. \n\n \n3. The inclusion of a property in the World Heritage List requires the consent of the \n\nState concerned. The inclusion of a property situated in a territory, sovereignty or \njurisdiction over which is claimed by more than one State shall in no way prejudice \nthe rights of the parties to the dispute. \n\n \n4. The Committee shall establish, keep up to date and publish, whenever circumstances \n\nshall so require, under the title of \"list of World Heritage in Danger\", a list of the \nproperty appearing in the World Heritage List for the conservation of which major \noperations are necessary and for which assistance has been requested under this \nConvention. This list shall contain an estimate of the cost of such operations. The list \nmay include only such property forming part of the cultural and natural heritage as is \nthreatened by serious and specific dangers, such as the threat of disappearance caused \nby accelerated deterioration, large-scale public or private projects or rapid urban or \ntourist development projects; destruction caused by changes in the use or ownership \nof the land; major alterations due to unknown causes; abandonment for any reason \nwhatsoever; the outbreak or the threat of an armed conflict; calamities and \ncataclysms; serious fires, earthquakes, landslides; volcanic eruptions; changes in \nwater level, floods and tidal waves. The Committee may at any time, in case of urgent \nneed, make a new entry in the List of World Heritage in Danger and publicize such \nentry immediately. \n\n \n5. The Committee shall define the criteria on the basis of which a property belonging to \n\nthe cultural or natural heritage may be included in either of the lists mentioned in \nparagraphs 2 and 4 of this article. \n\n \n6. Before refusing a request for inclusion in one of the two lists mentioned in paragraphs \n\n2 and 4 of this article, the Committee shall consult the State Party in whose territory \nthe cultural or natural property in question is situated. \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n7. The Committee shall, with the agreement of the States concerned, co-ordinate and \nencourage the studies and research needed for the drawing up of the lists referred to \nin paragraphs 2 and 4 of this article. \n\nArticle 12 \n\nThe fact that a property belonging to the cultural or natural heritage has not been included in \neither of the two lists mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 11 shall in no way be \nconstrued to mean that it does not have an outstanding universal value for purposes other \nthan those resulting from inclusion in these lists. \n\nArticle 13 \n\n1. The World Heritage Committee shall receive and study requests for international \nassistance formulated by States Parties to this Convention with respect to property \nforming part of the cultural or natural heritage, situated in their territories, and \nincluded or potentially suitable for inclusion in the lists mentioned referred to in \nparagraphs 2 and 4 of Article 11. The purpose of such requests may be to secure the \nprotection, conservation, presentation or rehabilitation of such property. \n\n \n2. Requests for international assistance under paragraph 1 of this article may also be \n\nconcerned with identification of cultural or natural property defined in Articles 1 and \n2, when preliminary investigations have shown that further inquiries would be \njustified. \n\n \n3. The Committee shall decide on the action to be taken with regard to these requests, \n\ndetermine where appropriate, the nature and extent of its assistance, and authorize the \nconclusion, on its behalf, of the necessary arrangements with the government \nconcerned. \n\n \n4. The Committee shall determine an order of priorities for its operations. It shall in so \n\ndoing bear in mind the respective importance for the world cultural and natural \nheritage of the property requiring protection, the need to give international assistance \nto the property most representative of a natural environment or of the genius and the \nhistory of the peoples of the world, the urgency of the work to be done, the resources \navailable to the States on whose territory the threatened property is situated and in \nparticular the extent to which they are able to safeguard such property by their own \nmeans. \n\n \n5. The Committee shall draw up, keep up to date and publicize a list of property for \n\nwhich international assistance has been granted. \n \n\n\n\n8 \n\n6. The Committee shall decide on the use of the resources of the Fund established under \nArticle 15 of this Convention. It shall seek ways of increasing these resources and \nshall take all useful steps to this end. \n\n \n7. The Committee shall co-operate with international and national governmental and \n\nnon-governmental organizations having objectives similar to those of this \nConvention. For the implementation of its programmes and projects, the Committee \nmay call on such organizations, particularly the International Centre for the Study of \nthe Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (the Rome Centre), the \nInternational Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the International \nUnion for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), as well as on \npublic and private bodies and individuals. \n\n \n8. Decisions of the Committee shall be taken by a majority of two-thirds of its members \n\npresent and voting. A majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a \nquorum. \n\nArticle 14 \n\n1. The World Heritage Committee shall be assisted by a Secretariat appointed by the \nDirector-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization. \n\n \n2. The Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \n\nOrganization, utilizing to the fullest extent possible the services of the International \nCentre for the Study of the Preservation and the Restoration of Cultural Property (the \nRome Centre), the International Council of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and the \nInternational Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) in \ntheir respective areas of competence and capability, shall prepare the Committee's \ndocumentation and the agenda of its meetings and shall have the responsibility for the \nimplementation of its decisions. \n\nIV FUND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE WORLD CULTURAL AND \nNATURAL HERITAGE \n\nArticle 15 \n\n1. A Fund for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage of Outstanding \nUniversal Value, called \"the World Heritage Fund\", is hereby established. \n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n2. The Fund shall constitute a trust fund, in conformity with the provisions of the \nFinancial Regulations of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization. \n\n \n3.

The \nCommittee may accept contributions to be used only for a certain programme or \nproject, provided that the Committee shall have decided on the implementation of \nsuch programme or project. No political conditions may be attached to contributions \nmade to the Fund. \n\n\n\n10 \n\nArticle 16 \n\n1. Without prejudice to any supplementary voluntary contribution, the States Parties to \nthis Convention undertake to pay regularly, every two years, to the World Heritage \nFund, contributions, the amount of which, in the form of a uniform percentage \napplicable to all States, shall be determined by the General Assembly of States Parties \nto the Convention, meeting during the sessions of the General Conference of the \nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. This decision of \nthe General Assembly requires the majority of the States Parties present and voting, \nwhich have not made the declaration referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article. In no \ncase shall the compulsory contribution of States Parties to the Convention exceed 1% \nof the contribution to the regular budget of the United Nations Educational, Scientific \nand Cultural Organization. \n\n \n2. However, each State referred to in Article 31 or in Article 32 of this Convention may \n\ndeclare, at the time of the deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or \naccession, that it shall not be bound by the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article. \n\n \n3. A State Party to the Convention which has made the declaration referred to in \n\nparagraph 2 of this Article may at any time withdraw the said declaration by notifying \nthe Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \nOrganization. However, the withdrawal of the declaration shall not take effect in \nregard to the compulsory contribution due by the State until the date of the \nsubsequent General Assembly of States parties to the Convention. \n\n \n4. In order that the Committee may be able to plan its operations effectively, the \n\ncontributions of States Parties to this Convention which have made the declaration \nreferred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, shall be paid on a regular basis, at least \nevery two years, and should not be less than the contributions which they should have \npaid if they had been bound by the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article. \n\n \n5. Any State Party to the Convention which is in arrears with the payment of its \n\ncompulsory or voluntary contribution for the current year and the calendar year \nimmediately preceding it shall not be eligible as a Member of the World Heritage \nCommittee, although this provision shall not apply to the first election. \n\n \n The terms of office of any such State which is already a member of the Committee \n\nshall terminate at the time of the elections provided for in Article 8, paragraph 1 of \nthis Convention. \n\n\n\n11 \n\nArticle 17 \n\nThe States Parties to this Convention shall consider or encourage the establishment of \nnational public and private foundations or associations whose purpose is to invite donations \nfor the protection of the cultural and natural heritage as defined in Articles 1 and 2 of this \nConvention. \n\nArticle 18 \n\nThe States Parties to this Convention shall give their assistance to international fund-raising \ncampaigns organized for the World Heritage Fund under the auspices of the United Nations \nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. They shall facilitate collections made by \nthe bodies mentioned in paragraph 3 of Article 15 for this purpose. \n\nV. CONDITIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL \nASSISTANCE \n\nArticle 19 \n\nAny State Party to this Convention may request international assistance for property forming \npart of the cultural or natural heritage of outstanding universal value situated within its \nterritory. It shall submit with its request such information and documentation provided for in \nArticle 21 as it has in its possession and as will enable the Committee to come to a decision. \n\nArticle 20 \n\nSubject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 13, sub-paragraph (c) of Article 22 and \nArticle 23, international assistance provided for by this Convention may be granted only to \nproperty forming part of the cultural and natural heritage which the World Heritage \nCommittee has decided, or may decide, to enter in one of the lists mentioned in paragraphs 2 \nand 4 of Article 11. \n\nArticle 21 \n\n1. The World Heritage Committee shall define the procedure by which requests to it for \ninternational assistance shall be considered and shall specify the content of the \nrequest, which should define the operation contemplated, the work that is necessary, \nthe expected cost thereof, the degree of urgency and the reasons why the resources of \nthe State requesting assistance do not allow it to meet all the expenses.  Such requests \nmust be supported by experts' reports whenever possible. \n\n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n2. Requests based upon disasters or natural calamities should, by reasons of the urgent \nwork which they may involve, be given immediate, priority consideration by the \nCommittee, which should have a reserve fund at its disposal against such \ncontingencies. \n\n \n3. Before coming to a decision, the Committee shall carry out such studies and \n\nconsultations as it deems necessary. \n\nArticle 22 \n\nAssistance granted by the World Heritage Fund may take the following forms: \n \n(a) studies  concerning the artistic, scientific and technical problems raised by the \n\nprotection, conservation, presentation and rehabilitation of the cultural and natural \nheritage, as defined in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article 11 of this Convention; \n\n \n(b) provisions of experts, technicians and skilled labour to ensure that the approved work \n\nis correctly carried out; \n \n(c) training of staff and specialists at all levels in the field of identification, protection, \n\nconservation, presentation and rehabilitation of the cultural and natural heritage; \n \n(d) supply of equipment which the State concerned does not possess or is not in a \n\nposition to acquire; \n \n(e) low-interest or interest-free loans which might be repayable on a long-term basis; \n \n(f) the granting, in exceptional cases and for special reasons, of non-repayable subsidies. \n\nArticle 23 \n\nThe World Heritage Committee may also provide international assistance to national or \nregional centres for the training of staff and specialists at all levels in the field of \nidentification, protection, conservation, presentation and rehabilitation of the cultural and \nnatural heritage. \n\nArticle 24 \n\nInternational assistance on a large scale shall be preceded by detailed scientific, economic \nand technical studies. These studies shall draw upon the most advanced techniques for the \nprotection, conservation, presentation and rehabilitation of the natural and cultural heritage \nand shall be consistent with the objectives of this Convention. The studies shall also seek \nmeans of making rational use of the resources available in the State concerned. \n\n\n\n13 \n\nArticle 25 \n\nAs a general rule, only part of the cost of work necessary shall be borne by the international \ncommunity. The contribution of the State benefiting from international assistance shall \nconstitute a substantial share of the resources devoted to each programme or project, unless \nits resources do not permit this. \n\nArticle 26 \n\nThe World Heritage Committee and the recipient State shall define in the agreement they \nconclude the conditions in which a programme or project for which international assistance \nunder the terms of this Convention is provided, shall be carried out.  It shall be the \nresponsibility of the State receiving such international assistance to continue to protect, \nconserve and present the property so safeguarded, in observance of the conditions laid down \nby the agreement. \n\nVI.
