environmentally sound and efficient management of such wastes, to minimise the amount and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated and ensure their environmentally sound management as close as possible to the source of generation and to assist developing countries in environmentally sound management of the hazardous and other wastes they generate.", "Summary or provisions: Parties prohibiting the import of hazardous wastes or other wastes undertake to inform the other Parties of their decision pursuant to article 13. The other Parties, when so informed, are to prohibit the export of hazardous wastes to the Parties that have prohibited the import of such waste (art. 4.1a).  Parties are to prohibit the export of hazardous wastes and other wastes if the State of import does not consent in writing to the specific import (art. 4.1c). Parties are to prohibit all persons under their national jurisdiction from transporting or disposing of hazardous wastes or other type of wastes unless such persons are authorised or allowed to perform such types of operations (art. 4.7a). They are to designate or establish one or more competent authorities as focal points to receive notifications (art. 5). States of export are not allow the generator of hazardous wastes or other wastes to commence the transboundary movement until they have received written confirmation that the notifier has received the written consent of the State of import (art. 6). Parties are to cooperate with each other in order to improve and achieve environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes and other wastes (art. 10). In case of an accident occurring during the transboundary movement of hazardous or other wastes or their disposal that is likely to present risks to human health and the environment in other States, those States must be immediately informed (art. 13).", "(Source: IUCN ELC, 08.2005, based on UNEP Register of International Treaties and Other Agreements in the Field of the Environment, 1996)"],

The other Parties, when so informed, are to prohibit the export of hazardous wastes to the Parties that have prohibited the import of such waste (art. 4.1a).  Parties are to prohibit the export of hazardous wastes and other wastes if the State of import does not consent in writing to the specific import (art. 4.1c). Parties are to prohibit all persons under their national jurisdiction from transporting or disposing of hazardous wastes or other type of wastes unless such persons are authorised or allowed to perform such types of operations (art. 4.7a). They are to designate or establish one or more competent authorities as focal points to receive notifications (art. 5). States of export are not allow the generator of hazardous wastes or other wastes to commence the transboundary movement until they have received written confirmation that the notifier has received the written consent of the State of import (art. 6). Parties are to cooperate with each other in order to improve and achieve environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes and other wastes (art. 10). In case of an accident occurring during the transboundary movement of hazardous or other wastes or their disposal that is likely to present risks to human health and the environment in other States, those States must be immediately informed (art. 13).", "(Source: IUCN ELC, 08.2005, based on UNEP Register of International Treaties and Other Agreements in the Field of the Environment, 1996)"],

annex A at the 1986 annual level. Developing countries consuming less than 0.3 kg per capita of the controlled substances, on the entry into force of the Protocol for them, may delay compliance with paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of article 2 of the Protocol by ten years, provided in that period they do not exceed 0.3 kg per capita (arts. 2 and 5). A year after the entry of the Protocol into force Parties may not import the substances from a non-party to the Protocol. After January 1993 developing countries may not export such substances to a non-party (arts. 4 and 5). The Protocol also provides for measures of exchange of technology and information, calculation of control levels and assessment and review of the progress achieved.", "(Source: IUCN ELC, 08.2005,

ensuring that environmental considerations are thoroughly taken into account in the development of plans and programs, contribute to the consideration of environmental concerns during the preparation of policies and legislation, establish clear, transparent and effective procedures for strategic environmental impact assessment and provide for public participation therein.", "Summary of provisions: Article 2 defines strategic environmental impact Each party undertakes to ensure that officials and authorities assist the public in matters covered by this Protocol (art.3.1) and to provide appropriate recognition and support to associations, organisations of groups promoting environmental protection (art.3.2).  The public is to be able to exercise its rights without discrimination  (art.3.7).  Each Party agrees to ensure that a strategic environmental assessment is carried out for plans and programmes prepared inter alia for agriculture, energy and transport, and which are likely to have significant environmental effects (art.4). Parties are to determine whether plans and programmes are likely to have significant environmental effects through a case- by-case examination and/or by specifying types of plans and programmes (art.5.1). Moreover, each Party is to endeavour to provide opportunities for the participation of the public concerned (art.4.3).  Parties are to establish arrangements for the determination of the relevant information to be included in the environmental report (art. 6) which must be prepared for plans and programmes subject to strategic environmental assessments (art.7).  The report is to identify, describe and evaluate the likely significant environmental effects of implementing the plan or programme and its reasonable alternatives (art.7.2). Parties are to ensure early, timely and effective opportunities for public participation, in the strategic environmental assessments when all options are open (art. 8.1).  Article 10 provides for transboundary consultations under certain conditions. The decision to adopt a plan or programme is to take due account of the conclusions of the environmental report as well as the measures to prevent, reduce or mitigate the adverse effects identified therein and the comments received (art. 11). Moreover, each Party undertakes to monitor the significant environmental effects of the implementation to identify unforeseen adverse effects and take appropriate remedial action (art. 12.1).", "Institutional mechanisms: The Meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context serves as the Meeting of the Parties to this Protocol (art.14.1).  It is, inter alia, to keep under regular review the implementation of this Protocol (art. 14.4). The Secretariat of the Convention is to serve as Secretariat of this Protocol (art. 17).", "(Source: IUCN ELC, 08.2005)"], "partyDateOfDefiniteSignature": ["0002-11-30T00:00:00Z",

inter alia ensuring that environmental considerations are thoroughly taken into account in the development of plans and programs, contribute to the consideration of environmental concerns during the preparation of policies and legislation, establish clear, transparent and effective procedures for strategic environmental impact assessment and provide for public participation therein.", "Summary of provisions: Article 2 defines strategic environmental impact Each party undertakes to ensure that officials and authorities assist the public in matters covered by this Protocol (art.3.1) and to provide appropriate recognition and support to associations, organisations of groups promoting environmental protection (art.3.2).  The public is to be able to exercise its rights without discrimination  (art.3.7).  Each Party agrees to ensure that a strategic environmental assessment is carried out for plans and programmes prepared inter alia for agriculture, energy and transport, and which are likely to have significant environmental effects (art.4). Parties are to determine whether plans and programmes are likely to have significant environmental effects through a case- by-case examination and/or by specifying types of plans and programmes (art.5.1). Moreover, each Party is to endeavour to provide opportunities for the participation of the public concerned (art.4.3).  Parties are to establish arrangements for the determination of the relevant information to be included in the environmental report (art. 6) which must be prepared for plans and programmes subject to strategic environmental assessments (art.7).  The report is to identify, describe and evaluate the likely significant environmental effects of implementing the plan or programme and its reasonable alternatives (art.7.2). Parties are to ensure early, timely and effective opportunities for public participation, in the strategic environmental assessments when all options are open (art. 8.1).  Article 10 provides for transboundary consultations under certain conditions. The decision to adopt a plan or programme is to take due account of the conclusions of the environmental report as well as the measures to prevent, reduce or mitigate the adverse effects identified therein and the comments received (art. 11). Moreover, each Party undertakes to monitor the significant environmental effects of the implementation to identify unforeseen adverse effects and take appropriate remedial action (art. 12.1).", "Institutional mechanisms: The Meeting of the Parties to the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context serves as the Meeting of the Parties to this Protocol (art.14.1).  It is, inter alia, to keep under regular review the implementation of this Protocol (art. 14.4). The Secretariat of the Convention is to serve as Secretariat of this Protocol (art. 17).", "(Source: IUCN ELC, 08.2005)"], "trLanguageOfDocument": ["English", "French", "Russian"], "trKeyword":

Summary of provisions: The Convention covers 'wetlands', a term which is defined in article 1. Each Contracting Party agrees to designate at least one national wetland for inclusion in a List of Wetlands of International Importance (art.2.1), and to consider its international responsibility for the conservation, management, wise use of migratory stocks of wildfowl when modifying the content of the List (art.2.6). Contracting Parties undertake to establish nature reserves in order to conserve wetland resources and to increase waterfowl populations through management. Parties further agree to co-operate in the exchange of information as well as in the implementation of the Convention, especially in the case of wetland extending over the territories of more than one Contracting Party, and to train personnel competent in the fields of wetland management and research (art. 4 and 5). Institutional mechanism: A Conference of Parties is established (art.6). The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources is designated to perform the bureau duties under the Convention (art.8)"], "partyDateOfDefiniteSignature":
