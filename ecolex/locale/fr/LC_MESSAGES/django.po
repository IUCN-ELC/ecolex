"While FAO was established in 1945, it draws on the legacy of the Institute "
"of International Agriculture (IIA), which was founded in 1905 to collect and "
"publish statistical information on farming and agricultural products. FAO’s "
"core mandate has always included the collection, analysis, interpretation "
"and dissemination of information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture "
"and, in 1948, the functions and assets of the IIA were transferred to it. "
"FAO has, in this way, been committed to the collection and dissemination of "
"legal and policy instruments on food, agriculture and natural resources "
"management for more than 70 years. From 1954 to 1994, the FAO Legal Office "
"published “Food and Agricultural Legislation”, an annual compilation of "
"significant, innovative and illustrative legislation. In 1995, this "
"publication was replaced by FAOLEX; a global, open access, database of "
"national legislation, policies and bilateral agreements in areas relevant to "
"FAO’s mandate. FAOLEX is constantly being updated (with an average of 8,000 "
"new entries per year) and currently contains legal and policy materials "
"drawn from more than 200 countries and regional economic integration "
"organizations, of which the key elements have been summarized in English, "
"French or Spanish based on original texts in over 40 languages. FAOLEX "
"complements the technical support for legislative and regulatory reform "
"provided to the FAO Member States by the Development Law Service of the FAO "
"Legal Office."
