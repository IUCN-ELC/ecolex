<h1>Privacy Statement</h1>
&nbsp;
<p>FAO, IUCN and UNEP are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to the ECOLEX Web site and governs data collection and usage. By using the ECOLEX website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.</p>
<h3>Collection of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>ECOLEX collects information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically provided to the ECOLEX server. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses. This information is used by ECOLEX for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the ECOLEX Web site.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through ECOLEX public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: ECOLEX does not read any of your private online communications.</p>
<p>ECOLEX encourages you to review the privacy statements of the Web sites you choose to link to from ECOLEX so that you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. ECOLEX is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the ECOLEX sites.</p>
<h3>Use of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>ECOLEX does not have any pages requesting from you any sensitive personally identifiable information. You may communicate with ECOLEX partners by e-mail. In this case ECOLEX collects and uses your personal information to operate the ECOLEX Web site and deliver the services you have requested. ECOLEX also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from ECOLEX and its affiliates. ECOLEX may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.</p>
<p>ECOLEX does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. ECOLEX may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, ECOLEX may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to ECOLEX, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p>
<p>ECOLEX does not use or disclose sensitive personal information without your explicit consent.</p>
<p>ECOLEX keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within ECOLEX, in order to determine what ECOLEX services are the most popular. This data may be used to deliver customized content and advertising within ECOLEX to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.</p>
<p>ECOLEX Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on ECOLEX or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ECOLEX; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of ECOLEX, or the public.</p>
<h3>Use of Cookies</h3>
<p>The ECOLEX Web site uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p>
<p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize ECOLEX pages, or register with ECOLEX site or services, a cookie helps ECOLEX to recall your specific information on subsequent visits.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the ECOLEX services or Web sites you visit.</p>
<h3>Security of your Personal Information</h3>
<p>As mentioned, ECOLEX does not have any pages requesting from you your user Id, password and/or any sensitive personally identifiable information. ECOLEX partners sites or the sites found by the search may have such pages. It is your responsibility to check in each specific case if the pages secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>
<h3>Changes to this Statement</h3>
<p>ECOLEX will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect customer feedback. ECOLEX encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how ECOLEX is protecting your information.</p>
<h3>Contact Information</h3>
<p>ECOLEX welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that ECOLEX has not adhered to this Statement, please contact ECOLEX at <a href="mailto:ECOLEX@iucn.org">ECOLEX@iucn.org</a>.
