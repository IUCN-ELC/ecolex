<h1>Why FAO, IUCN and UNEP?</h1>

<h3>A bit of history</h3>
<p>IUCN Environmental Law Centre (ELC) created a comprehensive information system on environmental law (ELIS) in the 1960's. ELIS, which was one of the first computerized legal information system, evolved into a large set of references to treaties, national legislation, soft law and legal literature, linked to documents held in the libraries of the ELC for the IUCN Environmental Law Programme. It continues to be one of the main assets of the capacity building activities of the IUCN Environmental Law Programme, as well as a constant source of expertise for the work of the Programme in the fields of law development, technical assistance, and expertise building.</p>
<p>While FAO was established in 1945, it draws on the legacy of the Institute of International Agriculture (IIA), which was founded in 1905 to collect and publish statistical information on farming and agricultural products. FAO’s core mandate has always included the collection, analysis, interpretation and dissemination of information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture and, in 1948, the functions and assets of the IIA were transferred to it. FAO has, in this way, been committed to the collection and dissemination of legal and policy instruments on food, agriculture and natural resources management for more than 70 years. From 1954 to 1994, the FAO Legal Office published “Food and Agricultural Legislation”, an annual compilation of significant, innovative and illustrative legislation. In 1995, this publication was replaced by FAOLEX; a global, open access, database of national legislation, policies and bilateral agreements in areas relevant to FAO’s mandate. FAOLEX is constantly being updated (with an average of 8,000 new entries per year) and currently contains legal and policy materials drawn from more than 200 countries and regional economic integration organizations, of which the key elements have been summarized in English, French or Spanish based on original texts in over 40 languages. FAOLEX complements the technical support for legislative and regulatory reform provided to the FAO Member States by the Development Law Service of the FAO Legal Office.</p>
<p>UNEP has over the years contributed the collection of jurisprudence and case law to the ECOLEX Portal. UNEP furthermore provides information decisions and resolutions by the governing bodies of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs).</p>
<p>InforMEA (<a href="http://www.informea.org">www.informea.org</a>) is the flagship of the MEA Information and Knowledge Management (MEA-IKM) Initiative, which comprises of over 20 Secretariats of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) administered by 4 UN entities and IUCN and supported by the European Union. While the ECOLEX section containing COP decisions has been developed with the support of the European Union the contents of this portal are the sole responsibility of the ECOLEX partners and can in no way be taken to reflect the views of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Initiative seeks to harmonize data standards across MEA Secretariats to allow for easier and more cost-effective development of information and knowledge tools. The InforMEA Portal compiles decisions and resolutions of the Conferences/Meetings of Parties (COP/MOP), semantically analyzed treaty text, ratification data and focal point information, national reports and national implementation plans and a joint MEA calendar.</p>
<p>InforMEA further provides an <a href="http://www.informea.org/e-learning">E-learning tool</a> offering self-paced and free introductory courses on MEAs and International Environmental Law and Conventions and <a href="http://www.informea.org/leo">LEO</a> – the InforMEA Thesaurus of term concepts governing this area of international law (<a href="https://youtu.be/bKmNindEWFg">learn more ></a>).</p>
<p>To join forces and combine the strength of the three organizations therefore made eminent sense, and while cooperation in this field between UNEP and IUCN was firstly mandated by the Governing Council of UNEP in 1995, it is in 2001 that a partnership Agreement was signed by FAO, IUCN and UNEP for the integration of their data, and of FAOLEX into ECOLEX.</p>
<p>The resulting combined information resource is the largest available on environmental law globally, with over hundred thousand references to relevant documents already being available on the web.</p>
